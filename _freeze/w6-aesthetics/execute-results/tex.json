In what is to my knowledge the only academic source to date to have explored the concept of the aesthetic in theoretical terms, [Guilherme Giolo and Michaël Berghman](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/12723) (2023) suggest that traditional conceptual frameworks such as genre, lifestyle, or subculture are no longer adequate to understanding the contemporary modalities of cultural identity and creativity. Instead, they explore the ubiquitous popular  concept of the \"aesthetic\" as the key component of a new analytical framework. What does an \"aesthetic\" in this contemporary sense consist of? We might start by examining the entry on [\"City Pop\"](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/City_Pop) on the [Aesthetics Wiki](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics_Wiki), a vast online catalogue of aesthetic styles from \"Algorave\" to \"Zombie Apocalyse\", \"Dark Academia\" to \"Visual-kei\", \"Cottagecore\" to \"Witch House\". Like many of the other entries about aesthetics that the reader is already acquainted with, however, the city pop entry, while a useful introduction, brings few surprises, opening with a bland definition of it as \"a subgenre of Pop music from Japan\". The remainder of the entry is a walkthrough of everything that  everyone at this conference already knows, with the obligatory  references to 1970s American AOR, YMO, and the California Dreaming of Hiroshi Nagai. What the entry doesn't get us much closer to, however, is understanding why city pop can be considered not just as a J-pop subgenre but an **aesthetic**. For that we need to go back to Giolo and Berghman.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n[![](img/plastic-love.webp){width=100}](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/City_Pop)\n\n:::\n\nOne of the defining components of what Giolo and Berghman call Internet aesthetics is their association with certain kinds of experience, and the corresponding feelings evoked by the memory of that experience: the experience of living in the world of 1950s America, for example, or the world of Harry Potter; the experience of living in a dystopian future; or, one might add, the experience of living on the American West Coast in the 1970s, or in Tokyo at the height of the bubble economy. While music is a key component of such experiences, it is only one modality within a larger cultural world. Imaginatively speaking, aesthetics recall the fantasy worlds of videogames and LARPing:\n\n>Experiences (and, likely, their importance for Internet aesthetics) seem to be even more evident in the titles of playlists associated with different aesthetics: “You are studying in a haunted library with ghosts” (dark academia playlist), “You found the entrance to a secret garden”, “You are falling for the protagonist in a fantasy novel” (light royaltycore), or “A playlist for old money living in the French countryside” (light academia). Even clearer here, multiple objects (songs) are grouped and given symbolic meaning under a new interpretive key. This key is experience-centered. Thus, it seems acceptable to assume that experience is also the goal of an Internet aesthetic: to become someone different, *to feel as if living in a different time* (2023) [Emphasis mine]\n\nThe dominant musical modality of aesthetics is the **playlist**, and playlists can be thought of as scripts or catalysts for certain kinds of experience: the dark cinematic vibe of *film noir* in jazz; chillout-room electronica; the moody self-absorption of shoegaze; the entire \"After Hours\" DJ session collection. Although originating in the album-based formats of the 1970s and 1980s, city pop today is something that we **experience** as much as just listen to, something  that conjures up a particular **structure of feeling** (as Raymond Williams used to call it); and the primary way we experience it is through the playlist, whether in the form of the compilation release (**Pacific Breeze**) or the endless-summer playlists of YouTube and Spotify. With the advent of the playlist, all music became background music---music **for** something, that creates the ambience for certain kinds of experience: studying, barbecueing, driving at night, lovemaking, being depressed after a breakup. Music has long had this function, of course; its origins go back to the so-called \"mood music\" of the 1950s, when stereophonic recording began to turn it into an environment: **Music For Lovers**; **Soothing Sounds for Baby**; and several decades later, **Music For Airports**. Since the 1990s, mood music has been replaced by the concept of **vibe**, but both are arguably about music as a catalyst for shared experience (or the imagination of such experience) and the structures of feeling associated with them. It’s no coincidence that the current generation of city pop fans around the globe are too young to have lived through the decades to which it provided the musical soundtrack, since **anemoia**—--nostalgia for something one never experienced directly—--is one of the key constituents of Internet aesthetics. To listen to an album today such as Tatsurō Yamashita's appropriately-titled **For You** (1982), most of us can only dream of another, better time and place, when Japan was still surfing the economic wave and the prevailing mood was for glamour and partying. A decade later, after the bubble had burst, while Yasuharu Konishi's Readymade Records continued to party like it was (not yet) 1999, the vibe of Shibuya-kei led by Crue-el and Trattoria Records was cooler, more circumspect, more indie---Music For The Morning After.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n[![](img/for-you.jpg){width=100}](https://youtu.be/loSQDPUHazQ)\n\n:::\n\nGiolo and Berghman also emphasize the affective dimension of Internet aesthetics, and their interviewees frequently reference feelings when describing them:\n\n>\"The aesthetics that I like really depend on my mood of the day. On Sundays, when it's sunny, I really enjoy aesthetic images that *give me this summer feeling*\" Jane (Dutch, prefers \"cottagecore\").\n>\n>Jane, who strongly connects \"cottagecore\" to morning walks, went on to explain that in those moments the scenarios and imaginaries of this Internet aesthetic \"flow\" into her activity, representing \"the things I would like at that moment. *They give me a warming feeling*\" (2023). [Emphasis mine]\n\nBy now we are (hopefully) getting closer to understanding what it means to describe city pop as an aeesthetic rather than just a musical genre. Like vaporwave, like future funk, like mallsoft, like lo-fi hip hop, city pop conjures up a particular kind of cultural-historical aesthetic experience and a corresponding affective structure, via playlists, imagery, and other elements. As has been much discussed in the case of vaporwave, the dominant  temperamental register is nostalgic and melancholic, invoking a bygone era of economic optimism and technological utopianism rendered only more poignant by the harsh realities of the dystopian present.\n",
