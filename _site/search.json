    "text": "} \n\n\nW6: Aesthetics\n\n\nGuilherme Giolo and Michaël Berghman, “The Aesthetics of the Self: The Meaning-Making of Internet Aesthetics” Aesthetics Wiki\nI’m assuming that you’re all very familiar with the notion of an aesthetic, but I’m also assuming that you’re not familiar with thinking about it from an analytical standpoint. But that’s exactly what we’re going to do this week, and what this week’s reading assignments are about. I think we can all agree that the term itself has become ubiquitous in contemporary youth culture, yet the concept itself remains surprisingly undiscussed or debated within that same culture; it’s as if all of us already know exactly what the term itself refers to, so discussions tend to circulate around specific aesthetics rather than on what the term itself is referring to. As media scholars, however, scrutinizing such supposedly transparent terms is precisely what we are required to do. In this week’s reading assignments and lecture, I hope that you’ll discover that the term “aesthetic” is a lot more pervasive, and a lot more complex than you may have realized. I would go so far as to argue that it’s one of the most important concepts of our time because it provides a framework within which we construct our very sense of identity. But in today’s youth culture, this process works very differently from how it has done until quite recently.\nTake a very well-known aesthetic like cyberpunk. If you take a look at the entry on the Aesthetics Wiki, you’ll discover (and you may know already) that the term “cyberpunk” originated in the literary sphere, specifically a subgenre of science fiction that originated in the early 1980s in the fiction of male Anglo-American novelists such as William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, while a variant of cyberpunk that subsequently devloped in the fiction of Neil Stephenson and others became known as steampunk, an equally well-known aesthetic today. The point here is that even though both cyberpunk and steampunk started out as popular subgenres of literary science fiction, they are today much more than just that. From its inception, in fact, cyberpunk was never an exclusively literary genre, and along with William Gibson’s novel Neuromancer (1984) Ridley Scott’s noirish, science fiction film Blade Runner (1982) has become synonymous with the genre. After Gibson’s film and Scott’s film, cyberpunk’s distinctive aesthetic became ubiquitous not just in other works of fiction and movies but also videogames and graphic novels, and today extends across the whole spectrum of contemporary media: no longer just a literary style, it’s a visual style (reprised in the recent sequel Blade Runner 2049 (2017)), a musical style (a derivative of the EDM genre synthwave), and a fashion style (cosplay); “Steampunk” is a popular Halloween outfit.\nDrawing on the older analytical framework of media semiotics, it’s of course interesting and fun to try to identify the the specific elements of the cyberpunk aesthetic. Of course, this isn’t limited to purely audiovisual elements and motifs—neon-drenched urban cityscapes at night, a heavily purple color palette, ambient electronic soundscapes inspired by the soundtrack of Blade Runner—but also characterization, plot structures, narrative themes, production design, costume design. Trying to define cyberpunk in this way quickly becomes a trickier task than it initially appears. Much the same argument could be made about other major aesthetics of our time, from goth to vaporwave. The point, though, is that even though aesthetics may originate in one particular medium, genre, or platform —literature, film, popular music, anime—they are no longer limited to any one of these but extend across them; this is, in fact, why they are more usefully defined as aesthetics. We’ve already seen a good example of this in the first week of classes, with the aesthetic of the Japanese Studio Ghibli, which as we have seen has its own distinctive aesthetic that has made it recognizable worldwide.\nYet it could also be suggested that as was the case with the historical cinematic genre known as film noir, cyberpunk, vaporwave, or Ghibli, their aesthetic is not just limited purely to their stylistic elements (visuals, music, etc.) or even their narratives or character design, but includes other elements that are a lot harder to define: a particular worldview, for example (nihilistic, humanistic, etrc.); a particular sensibility or emotional register that can be expressed by two other key contemporary concepts: mood and vibe. Just as cyberpunk has its own particuar vibe, so too in a very dfferent way do Ghibli movies. What are the characteristics of this mood or vibe in either case, and what exactly do we mean by “vibe” in the first place? It’s another term that is worth thinking about. I won’t say any more about it here, but encourage you to reflect upon it in this week’s discussion forum.\nSo what, exactly, is an aesthetic? In what is to my knowledge the only academic source to date to have explored the concept of the aesthetic in theoretical terms, Guilherme Giolo and Michaël Berghman (2023) suggest that traditional conceptual frameworks such as genre, lifestyle, or subculture are no longer adequate to understanding the contemporary modalities of cultural identity and creativity. Instead, they explore the concept of the “aesthetic” as the key component of a new analytical framework. What does an “aesthetic” in this contemporary sense consist of? One of the defining components of what Giolo and Berghman call Internet aesthetics is their association with certain kinds of experience, and the corresponding feelings evoked by the memory of that experience: the experience of living in the world of 1950s America, for example, or the world of Harry Potter; the experience of living in a dystopian future; or, one might add, the experience of living on the American West Coast in the 1970s, or in Tokyo at the height of the bubble economy. While music is a key component of such experiences, it is only one modality within a larger cultural world. Imaginatively speaking, aesthetics recall the fantasy worlds of videogames and LARPing:\n\nExperiences (and, likely, their importance for Internet aesthetics) seem to be even more evident in the titles of playlists associated with different aesthetics: “You are studying in a haunted library with ghosts” (dark academia playlist), “You found the entrance to a secret garden”, “You are falling for the protagonist in a fantasy novel” (light royaltycore), or “A playlist for old money living in the French countryside” (light academia). Even clearer here, multiple objects (songs) are grouped and given symbolic meaning under a new interpretive key. This key is experience-centered. Thus, it seems acceptable to assume that experience is also the goal of an Internet aesthetic: to become someone different, to feel as if living in a different time (2023). [Emphasis mine]\n\nGiolo and Berghman also emphasize the affective dimension of Internet aesthetics, and their interviewees frequently reference feelings when describing them:\n\n“The aesthetics that I like really depend on my mood of the day. On Sundays, when it’s sunny, I really enjoy aesthetic images that give me this summer feeling” Jane (Dutch, prefers “cottagecore”).\nJane, who strongly connects “cottagecore” to morning walks, went on to explain that in those moments the scenarios and imaginaries of this Internet aesthetic “flow” into her activity, representing “the things I would like at that moment. They give me a warming feeling” (2023). [Emphasis mine]\n\nBy now we are (hopefully) getting closer to understanding what it means to describe city pop as an aesthetic rather than just a musical genre. Like vaporwave, like future funk, like mallsoft, like lo-fi hip hop, city pop conjures up a particular kind of cultural-historical aesthetic experience and a corresponding affective structure, via playlists, imagery, and other elements. As has been much discussed in the case of vaporwave, the dominant temperamental register is nostalgic and melancholic, invoking a bygone era of economic optimism and technological utopianism rendered only more poignant by the harsh realities of the dystopian present."

    "section": "",
    "text": "W2: Simulation & Pastiche: Postmodernism\n\n\n\nAmalia Ulman; Instagram Alastair Sooke, “Is This The First Instagram Masterpiece?” (The Telegraph, 18 January 2016) “Amalia Ulman: Meme Come True” (Dazed) Emilie Friedlander, “Social Anxiety: Why Amalia Ulman’s Fake ‘Middlebrow’ Instagram Is No Different From Yours,” (Fader, 7 November 2014)\nTo watch:\nEl Planeta (Amalia Ulman, 2020) Inventing Anna, episode 6 (Netflix, 2022)\nClaudio Bravo, Madonna (1979)\nYou’ve heard of postmodernism, of course—who hasn’t? As arguably the most influential cultural movement of the past half century, it’s almost inescapable today, ubiquitous across the spectrum of the arts, from Warhol to Jeff Koons, Twin Peaks to Stranger Things, Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction to Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs—okay that’s enough, I could go on for the entire lecture…\nBut what exactly is postmodernism? When did it start? And has it ended yet? In keeping with my approach in the course thus far, rather than plunging into dense theoretical texts, we will explore postmodernist aesthetics through some representative examples—in this case the works of the U.S. artist Cindy Sherman and the more recent Argentinian artist Amalia Ulman.\nSince there simply isn’t sufficient space here to explore all of the many facets of postmodernism, some basic distinctions and pointers will have to suffice. For a deeper dive, your starting point should probably be Fredric Jameson’s influential essay, “Postmodernism or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism”, followed by his book; or the French social theorist Jean Baudrillard’s classic book Simulacra and Simulations. But you don’t have to start with either of these texts. The first book I read on postmodernism was actually about architecture, Charles Jenks’s book The Language of Postmodernist Architecture, which has some illuminating discussion of the differences between modernist and postmodernist architecture.\nAn initial distinction is useful between postmodernism, which refers to an aesthetic movement extending across the spectrum of the arts, and postmodernity, a broader term that refers to a general condition (the reference points here being Jean-François Lyotard’s influential book The Postmodern Condition and David Harvey’s The Condition of Postmodernity) of society that has come to characterize the experience of global societies in the second half of the twentieth century and the first part of the twenty-first. I’m not going to get into the nature of postmodernity here, but suffice to say that postmodernism in the arts can be thought of as the artistic and cultural counterpart of the conditon of postmodernity itself.\nWhat follows can be considered a kind of “Postmodernism 101” that assumes that you know very little about postmodernism at the outset, and suggests some lines of inquiry to follow if you’re interested in exploring it in more depth.\nSo what do the diverse group of artists mentioned so far—Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, David Lynch, Quentin Tarantino, Jeff Koons, Wes Anderson, Amalia Ulman, and many more—have in common, aesthetically speaking?\nWhile people who have tried to define postmodernism agree that it can mean many different things, most would agree that one of its defining characteristics is pastiche, or what Fredric Jameson called “blank parody”. Pastiche here refers to the mimicry of particular historical styles, irrespective of the artistic field in question—painting, architecture, cinema, television, music, comics, and so on.\nConsider, for example, the image at the top of this page, Madonna by the Chilean artist Claudio Bravo. At first glance, you might easily mistake it for a Renaissance painting, in terms of its apparently religious subject matter, the vaguely biblical background that recalls religious illustrated books, and the symmetrical composition. The figure on the left pierced with arrows, for example, recalls the Christian martyr St. Sebastian, the subject of numerous Renaissance paintings. It might come as a surprise, then, to learn that the painting is a contemporary one (1979). The image first came to my attention in the early 1990s when it was used on the cover of an album by the Ensemble Alcatraz, Visions and Miracles (1988), a vocal group specializing in medieval and early modern music based in the San Franciso Bay area. The label website describes the album thus:\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula in the 13th century was home to a great exchange of cultures. One result: the cantiga, a combination of old and new musics from Christian, Muslim, and Jewish sources that told stories of adventure, calamity, and redemption, here brought to life by the Ensemble Alcatraz.\n\nIn Claudio Bravo’s pastiche of Renaissance painting, and the Ensemble Alcatraz’s eclectic pastiches of 13th-century Iberian music, we are already deeply immersed in postmodernist aesthetics. One of the characteristics of postmodernist painting is a return to figurative representation, in reaction against the abstraction that was one of the hallmarks of modernist painting, from the geometric minimalism of Mondrian to the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock.\nOne could spend a lot of time exploring postmodernist aesthetics simply within painting, from the 1960s “Pop Art” of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein to more recent examples. Both of these artists exemplify another key principle of postmodernist aesthetics: the embrace of popular media such as comics and the mass-cultural imagery of advertising, collapsing the modernist hierarchy between “high” (avant-garde) art and the “low” art (kitsch) of consumer mass culture.\nRather than painting, a particularly interesting starting point for exploring postmodernist aesthetics is photography. The 1970s saw the emergence of a number of female artists whose work engaged in different ways with photography as a means of elaborating a new, postmodernist aesthetics. They included Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, Sherrie Levine, or Sandy Skoglund (I leave you to Google any of these), but the two artists that I’m going to discuss today are of particular interest because of how their photographic work engages with the cinematic (Cindy Sherman) and social media (Amalia Ulman).\n\nCindy Sherman\nCindy Sherman is best known for her series of photographs (I think there are over 70 in all) dating from the late 1970s (1977-80) in which she elaborately stages stereotypical female roles that look uncannily like they are film stills from popular movies—the only difference being that the movies in question don’t exist. The main image for the course syllabus is a collage of some of the best-known of these photographs. Take a closer look at it, and click on the image to find out more about the series.\n\nSo what is “postmodernist” about this project? First, and related to the earlier discussion, because as the title of the series itself (Untitled Film Stills) makes clear, the photographs pastiche (that is, mimic or imitate) the visual style of the film still as a media format often seen in newspapers, magazines, and promotional matierals (such as film posters). In addition to the photographs’ formal mimicry of the film still, moreover, they also pastiche the visual style of popular films genres often problematized for their stereotypical portrayals of women, notably the well-known femme fatale stereotype of 1940s-1950s film noir. Some of Cindy Sherman’s photographs can be seen as pastiching the visual codes of film noir, most obviously in her decision to shoot on black-and-white film stock, reproducing the monochromatic look that is one of the most striking visual characteristics of film noir. It should be remembered that while the default film stock for photographers (especially photojournalists) well into the 1960s was black and white, even though shooting in color had been technically possible long before then, by the 1970s color had so become the norm that to choose to shoot in black and white already lent a retro that has become one of the hallmarks of postmodernist aesthetics. Sherman’s decision to shoot in black and white, then, is another (easily overlooked) element of their stylistic pastiche of the monochromatic aesthetic both of film noir and historical photography.\nWhat’s so fascinating about Sherman’s film stills, though, is that even though some of them can be seen as stylistic pastiches of film noir, in many other photographs it’s far less clear which cinematic genre is the object of pastiche. While there’s often a strong visual sense of déjà vu, evoking a popular film of the 1950s or 1960s, they key point is the indeterminacy of the reference—the fact that we can’t identify the photograph with any specific historical film or film genre.\nThis brings us to another defining concept of postmodernist aesthetics: simulation. The concept was elaborated in several classic essays in the 1970s by the French social theorist Jean Baudrillard, notably in his book (mentioned earler) Simulacra and Simulations (1979). For Baudrillard, the postmodern world is dominated by what he calls simulacra (sing. “simulacrum”), a new form of representation that essentially reverses the hierarchical relationship between the model and the copy. Historically, in the history of art, the model—in the form of the original work of art—has always preceded the copy: there is only one Mona Lisa, even though there are thousands of copies of Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting. The age of what Baudrillard calls the simulacrum—the postmodernist age—is defined by the reversal of this hierarchy, by the ascendancy of copies without models (which is what Baudrillard means by simulacra). Whereas in the era of realism, what was still understood as the “real world” preceded representation of it (regardless of the medium—literature, painting, photography, cinema, TV), by the 1970s, Baudrillard argued, the relationship between the real and representation had reversed, or perhaps more accurately the distinction between the two had collapsed: henceforth, claimed Baudrillard, “reality” had become effectively indistinguishable from mass-media representations of it, or what he and the Italian semiotic theorist Umberto Eco called hyperreality.This is why the Mona Lisa has what Walter Benjamin calls aura, its historical uniqueness in space and time\nWe don’t need to go any further at this point to understand how the photography of Cindy Sherman, as well as many other artists like her in the 1970s, could be seen as an artistic commentary on the hyperrealist world that Baudrillard was describing. Sherman’s Film Stills photographs are also copies without models in the sense that what semiotic theorists would call their referent—the original film from which they are sourced—does not exist. They are what Baudrillard might call cinematic simulacra.\nOver the past few decades, Cindy Sherman has become increasingly revered as one of the most influential figures in the emergence of postmodernist aesthetics since the 1970s. Her photographic critique of stereotypical representations of women in popular cinema was part of the larger current of feminist critiques of patriarchal representation, from Laura Mulvey’s influential critique of the male gaze in her mid-1970s essay to Chantal Akerman’s groundbreaking film Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975). Sherman has continued her exploration of female representation right up to the present, and even has an Instagram account. An episode of the recent Netflix series Inventing Anna includes an episode in which characters discuss her work at a gallery retrospective, and includes a brief cameo by Sherman herself, wearing the same head-scarfed outfit that she wears in one of her original Film Stills photographs, essentially re-enacting her own earlier roleplay in the photograph. (Could it be any more postmodernist?!?). The inclusion of Sherman in the show could scarcely be more appropriate, given that its subject is Anna Sorokin, who conned luxury hotels and her wealthy New York socialite friends by masquerading as a German heiress called Anna Delvey–another stunningly postmodernist example of “representation” usurping the place of reality.\n\n\nAmalia Ulman\nCindy Sherman’s Instagram account (in fact, she has several) provides a link between her 1970s performance-art photography exploring female identity and the work of the social media artist Amalia Ulman, which can arguably be seen as continuing Sherman’s project in the twenty-first century domain of social media. If you read any of the articles about Ulman’s work linked to as this week’s reading assignments, you should by now have a good idea of how she fits into the larger framework of postmodernism that I have been sketching out in the preceding discussion. As with Sherman’s Film Stills, and as with a number of similar postmodernist feminist artists (the French artist Sophie Calle is another example), in her fake Instagram account Ulman fabricated a stereotypical female persona as an art project, exposing through the sexist comments of her male admirers the continuing pressure on young women to conform to the visual pleasure of the male gaze almost half a century since Laura Mulvey’s critique, and in spite of “postfeminist” celebrations of the power of female sexuality Ulman’s work can in fact be seen as developing such as critique through masquerade, photography, and social media platforms in a manner that continues the artistic critiques of so many other postmodernist feminist artists since the 1970s.\nJust as Cindy Sherman’s Film Stills project explored stereotypical representations of women in cinema, Amalia Ulman has recently gone a step further by directing her first feature film, El Planeta, that continues her exploration of representations of female identity in the social media age more directly in cinematic form. The film’s opening sequence again sees Ulman role-playing, this time posing as a call girl negotiating sexual and financial arrangements with a future client in what subsequently proves to be (like her Instagram persona) a pure fabrication that ruthlessly exposes the objectification of women in patriarchal society. The masquerades continue after this initial one, from her later (apparent) impersonation of an international designer to her later romantic roleplay in her date with the Asian guy that she meets in the gift shop. Both she herself and her mother (played, in fact, by Ulman’s own mother), it turns out, are engaged in role-playing a fantasy of a glamorous lifestyle that has no relation to their actual socio-economic status—a masquerade that is ultimately exposed in the mother’s arrest for shoplifting with which the film ends.\nIt’s worth noting, finally, that as with Cindy Sherman’s film stills, Ulman’s 2022 film is also in black and white, stylistically pastiching not film noir in this case but the French New Wave films of Jean-Luc Godard, Agnès Varda, or François Truffaut, many of which also engage with the problematic position of women in the French society of their time. It’s interesting in this regard to think about the relationship between El Planeta and Varda’s film Cléo from 5 to 7, or Godard’s film with Anna Karina, Vivre Sa Vie which explores themes similar to those in Ulman’s film. I leave you to think about those connections, but suffice to say that Ulman’s black-and-white pastiche of a New Wave film also attests to the legacy of postmodernist aesthetics half a century after Cindy Sherman’s iconic film stills.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "W1: Introduction: Sites of Struggle\n\n\n David Welch, “The Conquest of the Masses” (from The Third Reich: Politics and Propaganda (1993))\nUmberto Eco, “Semiological Guerrilla Warfare” (from Travels in Hyperreality: Essays, trans. William Weaver (San Diego: Harcourt, Inc., 1983))\nWhere to begin?\nOn the most fundamental level, the field of media today can be described as a site of struggle—or more accurately, as a multiplicity of sites of struggle: struggles over the representation and interpretation of real-world events; struggles over identity and whose voices are heard (and whose not); struggles over the political use of media, whether as a tool of corporate or state control, or resistance to it; struggles over ownership and property rights; struggles over media ethics; struggles over creativity and aesthetics; struggles over the environmental impact of media and communication technologies, and many more.\nPerhaps most importantly, though, today’s digital, networked media technologies and social media platforms are sites of struggle over meaning: over the often multiple, often contradictory meanings of media texts, practices, or rituals. The task of media criticism arguably begins with the question of meaning: what certain forms of cultural or media expression mean to different publics and audiences, and how meaning itself is not inherent or self-evident, but socially constructed by the often contradictory interpretations of different communities.\nWithin this larger, continually evolving field of meaning-making, media criticsm involves the analysis and decoding of media texts within specific interpretative frameworks, some of which we will be exploring in this course. They are drawn from a multiplicity of fields of knowledge in the humanities and social sciences, including linguistics (semiotics), literary theory (narrative), political economy (Marxism), psychoanalysis, social theory, feminism, ethnography, and cultural studies.\nThe fact that the interpretations of the same media texts are frequently contradictory doesn’t mean that they are equivalent in value in a relativistic way. On the contrary, many of the historical and still ongoing struggles over media meangings are struggles over power—over whose media practice, whose interpretation, is the dominant or valid one. It is often the practices and intrepretations of the most dominant groups within a society, or between societies, that are held to be the most valid ones. But resistant intrepretations and practices are always present, even when repressed, and may challenge or destabilize those of dominant socio-political groups.\nA Contemporary Example: Ghiblification\nIf all this sounds very abstract, it is useful to begin with a concrete example that exemplifies many of the preceding points. The example that I propose we consider this week is a very recent media practice that first emerged last spring (2025) and quickly became a site of struggle in all of the ways described above. It relates to generative AI—already in itself a huge site of struggle over the past few years—and specifically the upgrade to OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool last spring that introduced a new affordance that quickly became nothing less than a global media phenomenon: the ability to convert any photograph into the distinctive visual style of the globally popular Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli, using only a simple textual request (e.g. “Convert this into a still from a Studio Ghibli movie”). As with all of meme culture, many of the hundreds (probably thousands) of images generated quickly spread across social media platforms.\nI expect that all of you may have come across the phenomenon at the time, since it was so ubiquitous, but you may have been less aware of its scale and the controversies sparked by many of the practices that emerged from it. In case you missed it, though, and to get a sense of the scale of the phenomenon, take a look at this slideshow that I put together at the time.\nAmong the wildfire of controversies generated by the AI-Ghibli phenomenon, perhaps the most unexpected–often shocking–was its use use in political and indeed geopolitical contexts. To the outcry of many, even the White House appropriated the trend as part of its clampdown on immigration by posting a Ghiblified image on its official Instagram feed. But this was not an isolated event: take a look at this Twitter thread about the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\nAs you can see from the initial posts on the thread, it appears that the posting of Ghiblified photographs relating to the Gaza conflict was initiated by the Israeli Defence Force, but if you continue scrolling you will see that the practice was also used by pro-Palestinian or anti-Zionist sources. Just scrolling through this feed alone, I think you can see what I meant earlier by describing media as a site of struggle.\nWhile this may seem like a particularly complex example, I would argue that it’s actually quite typical of the complexities of contemporary media culture and the challenges it poses to the analysis of that culture. Within meme culture alone, one need only consider the strange afterlife of the Pepe The Frog meme, which was the subject of the documentary Feels Good Man (dir. Arthur Jones, 2020). If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend that you watch it, as it’s extremely relevant to our course!\nAs a cultural and political practice, media criticism sets out to make sense of all of this. How does it do this? What kinds of frameworks would enable us to understand examples such as the AI-Ghibli phenomenon or the alt-right’s political appropriation of the Pepe The Frog meme in the lead-up to the 2016 US election? Who would have thought that the charming visual style of Studio Ghibli’s much-loved films, many directed by the self-professed pacifist Hayao Miyazaki, would be appropriated as what appears to be a contemporary form of propaganda? Why would the White House, the IDF, or other political actors appropriate that style? What are they trying to communicate by doing so? I leave you to consider such questions, and am curious to hear what you think.\nIf you were wondering, then, why I assigned you to read one of the early chapters from David Welch’s study of propaganda in the Third Reich, or Umberto Eco’s chapter on what he calls “semiological guerrilla warfare”, then by now you may have a better understanding why. Even though Eco’s concept dates from the early 1980s, the AI-Ghibli images amply demonstrate that the age of social media, still several decades away at the time, is today very much a field of semiological guerrilla warfare—not just a war in the human sense but also a war of signs: the signs in question being the existing global cultural mythology of Studio Ghibli itself, which is appropriated in different contexts and for different political purposes as a kind of second-order ideological language. This appropriation of an existing corpus of signs within (global) culture is one of the fundamental practices of what the French literary theorist Roland Barthes called “Mythologies” in his 1957 book of the same name: the process by which ideology presents itself as “normal” or “natural” rather than historical and dependent on highly unequal political, economic, and social dynamics.\nA wider question raised by the examples I’ve been discussing are about the nature of propaganda itself. What exactly is “propaganda”? David Welch’s book on the Third Reich offers some useful starting points for reflecting on this subject, and its relevance to contemporary geopolitical contexts. If you’re interested in exploring this subject further, you’ll certainly need to watch Leni Riefenstahl’s film Triumph of the Will (1935), regarded as the class text of the Nazi propaganda machine. It still makes for chilling viewing today.",

    "text": "I wanted to introduce you to Allissa Richardson’s book Bearing Witness While Black for a number of reasons.\n\nBecause I think it’s one of the most important books on social media to come out in recent years;\nBecause of its conceptual richness and utility in providing a systematic framework for understanding the role of social media as a platform for witnessing.\nAs a reminder that social media is not just about marketing and entertainment, but is also a political practice, specifically in this case in relation to the politics of identity.\nTo provide a framework for thinking about race in relation to social media.\nBecause it’s extremely relevant to a social justice struggle that’s still going on in the US right now. You’ll have seen (W3 Sources, below)  that there was another incident involving video and social media happened just last week in Denver; ironically, the black 14-year old shot by police has the same name as the author of the book itself: Richardson.\n\nAcross the two chapters, various older analytical frameworks for witnessing are referenced, but I think that Richardson makes a compelling case for the historical specificity of Black witnessing in particular (I didn’t assign chapter 2, but that covers the historical part, in terms of the role of early Black newspapers, etc.).\n\n\nOne of the most important concepts that’s introduced is the notion of the public sphere, and of Black public spheres in particular, I remember reading the special issue of the journal Public Culture, “The Black Public Sphere,” when it came out in 1994. \nThe concept of the public sphere itself remains very relevant today, particularly in the context of social media, and I was wondering whether you’d come across the concept in any previous classes, as well as what you thought of the concept of counterpublics that Richardson elaborates.\nAs you’ll have seen if you read it, the first part of chapter 3 focuses primarily on the interviews with participants in Black Lives Matter and other activists. Among these, the work of the data scientist Samuel Sinyangwe is particularly interesting. He is definitely worth following on Twitter, and check out his current project, Police Scorecard.\n\n\n\nIn terms of concepts, the latter part of the chapter frequently references the concepts of news frames, which are to do with the crucial concept of representation. Both Black Lives Matter and Richardson are engaged in critiquing the existing dominant news frames of legacy media (I love the use of this term legacy media to describe old-school news networks like Fox or CNN! It makes them seem so out of touch with what’s happening on the ground.)\nOne key theoretical concept that’s mentioned a few times by Richardson is the notion of the white racial frame, a term first elaborated by Joe Feagin in his 2013 book of the same name. Essentially, all of the legacy news frames discussed by Richardson (from Wolf Blitzer on down…) are examples of Feagin’s concept. I’m attaching the Preface and Introduction to Feagin’s book here in case you’re interested in reading them.\nHow events such as police beatings or shootings of unarmed black citizens is framed, in terms of what kind of story is told about those events and who tells it, is the key political issue in relation to news frames. The question then is, whose frame is the dominant one? What emerges clearly from Richardson’s book is that the Black appropriation of social media platforms such as Twitter has served to challenge and destabilize the historical hegemony of the white racial frame in legacy news media outlets, often exposing their distortions and biases.\nIn her book Twitter and Tear Gas, the Turkish journalist Zeynep Tufekci has also explored this socially progressive dimension of social media platforms in relation to resistance movements in the Middle Eastern region, particularly the Arab Spring in Egypt and Tunisia in 2011, as well as resistance movements in Turkey. That’s a separate topic though, which we can explore later in the course if people are interested in going further down that road.Zeynep Tufekci, Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protes (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2017).\n\nTo finish for this week, here are some additional materials relating to Black witnessing in particular that will be of interest. I highly recommend the video interview with Allissa Richardson below, while the articles about Tyre Nichols earlier this year also raise complex questions about the ethical issues raised by the increasing circulation and visibility of videos on social media platforms, whether by citizen journalists, CCTV footage, or police body cameras. The question about our social/political responsibility to watch these often extremely disturbing videos (from Rodney King to Tyre Nichols) is a key subject of debate right now. As Allissa Richardson puts it in the interview below:\n\nI would like to get to the point where we don’t need the videos to believe black people […] Why are black people asked to produce this footage to kind of pre-litigate the fact that they didn’t deserve their own demise?\n\n–Allissa Richardson, quoted in Mirna Wabi-Sabi, “Lula and the Yanomami: Uproar Over Photos in Brazil,” plataforma9, 25 January 2023.\n\nHistorical witnessing: Travelling While Black (2019) (VR documentary), available from the Meta store.\n\n\n\n\nSarah Smith, “Anger and hope for change at Tyre Nichols funeral” (BBC News, 2 February 2023).\nShira Ovide, “Do you have a moral duty to watch the police beating of Tyre Nichols?” (Washington Post, 31 January 2023).\nDavid Graeber, “Ferguson and the Criminalization of American Life” (Gawker, 15 March 2015).",

    "text": "One of the most important concepts that’s introduced is the notion of the public sphere, and of Black public spheres in particular, I remember reading the special issue of the journal Public Culture, “The Black Public Sphere,” when it came out in 1994. \nThe concept of the public sphere itself remains very relevant today, particularly in the context of social media, and I was wondering whether you’d come across the concept in any previous classes, as well as what you thought of the concept of counterpublics that Richardson elaborates.\nAs you’ll have seen if you read it, the first part of chapter 3 focuses primarily on the interviews with participants in Black Lives Matter and other activists. Among these, the work of the data scientist Samuel Sinyangwe is particularly interesting. He is definitely worth following on Twitter, and check out his current project, Police Scorecard.",

    "text": "In terms of concepts, the latter part of the chapter frequently references the concepts of news frames, which are to do with the crucial concept of representation. Both Black Lives Matter and Richardson are engaged in critiquing the existing dominant news frames of legacy media (I love the use of this term legacy media to describe old-school news networks like Fox or CNN! It makes them seem so out of touch with what’s happening on the ground.)\nOne key theoretical concept that’s mentioned a few times by Richardson is the notion of the white racial frame, a term first elaborated by Joe Feagin in his 2013 book of the same name. Essentially, all of the legacy news frames discussed by Richardson (from Wolf Blitzer on down…) are examples of Feagin’s concept.
