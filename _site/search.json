    "text": "W7: Revenge of the Nerds: Fandom\n\nMaking great music and being great on stage no longer seem to be enough.\n\n—Nancy Baym\nAre you a superfan? Or just a fan? Who are you a fan of?\n\n\n Nancy K. Baym, “Social Media and the Struggle for Society” Nancy K. Baym, Daniel Cavicchi, and Norma Coates, “Music Fandom in the Digital Age: A Conversation”\nSee also: Lauren Mayberry, “Chvrches’ Lauren Mayberry: ‘I will not accept online misogyny’” (The Guardian, 30 September 2013. \nWhether it’s a band, a filmmaker, an influencer, a sports team, or a videogame, we are all fans of somebody or something now. Fandom today is a social obligation, an expected marker of normal socialization: to not to be a fan of anything is weird, an indicator of social alienation. But even the socially alienated—known in Japan as otaku (roughly, nerds) or in extreme cases, hikikomori (shut-ins, who never leave their room and spend all their waking lives immersed in online gameworlds) are fans, even superfans. It’s not always been this way, of course. Back in 1986, nerdy Star Trek fans were still being lampooned in SNL comedy skits. Even back then, though, nobody would have considered telling obsessive sports fans to “get a life”, because being a fan of an actual sports team was not considered as excessive. But Star Trek was “just” a TV show, whose legitimacy as an object of such excessive devotion was far less obvious, given the longstanding (and still persistent) perception of television as trivial entertainment. This also explains, by the way, why fandom only began to be taken seriously in academia as a legitimate object of study from the 1990s onwards, beginning with Henry Jenkins’s classic study of Star Trek fandom Textual Poachers in 1992, and soon after Constance Penley’s NASA/Trek Other areas of media fandom, particularly around Japanese anime, have taken much longer to establish their legitimacy. It can be seen from these examples that perceptions of fandom are intertwined with the status within the dominant culture of the media or platforms that are the object of the fandom in question (popular music, film, TV, videogames, anime, TikTok).Henry Jenkins, Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture (New York: Routledge, 1992). Constance Penley, NASA/Trek: Popular Science and Sex in America (New York: Verso, 1997).\nFast forward a few decades, and as you see from the discussion about music fandom between Nancy Baym, Daniel Cavicchi, and Norma Coates, fandom has become a large and well-established field within media studies and related fields (cultural studies, ethnography). No longer stigmatized as in the 1990s, the nerd has become a staple of mainstream entertainment, from Napoleon Dynamite to The Big Bang Theory and its spinoff, Young Sheldon. How, when, and particularly why this cultural shift happened is a larger set of questions that there isn’t space to adequately address here, but has also been the subject of much theorizing in the academic literature on fandom.\nSo much for the background; but let’s come back to the specific focus of the second article assigned for this week: music fandom and its changing modalities in the emergence of digital culture and social media since the 1990s. For reasons explained above, books such as Kaitlyn Tiffany’s first-person study of One Direction fans are today routine. It’s fine to publicly obsess over Harry Styles or other boy-band idols, while media scholars are devoting entire academic syllabi to Taylor Swift. Since fandom today has become such a vast field, then, I’ll limit myself to a couple of observations arising from the article on music fandom in the social media age that may provide some starting points for this week’s discussion.Kaitlyn Tiffany, Everything I Need I Get From You: How Fangirls Created the Internet as We Know It (New York: Farrar, Strauss & Giroux, 2022).\nThe first of these relates to the question of race in relation to fandom. On the last page of the discussion of music fandom, Nancy Baym observes:\n\nI think, for example, of black punks, and how they, like punk women (and, most of all, like black punk women), have already been written out of histories of punk. Fan scholarship has begun to talk about race, as phenomena like casting white actors to play Asian characters has become a topic that increasingly merits discussion beyond the purviews of fandoms themselves (151).\n\nWhile Baym’s point itself is valid enough, it’s significant that it’s is the only reference to race in this discussion of music fandom by these three white scholars. While (as is clear from the discussion) the relationship between fandom and gender identities has been a major focus of attention in academic discussions of fandom, from Beatlemania to One Direction, it’s also true that until relatively recently the field of fandom studies has been overwhelmingly dominated by studies of predominantly white fandoms by white scholars who have largely ignored racial and ethnic identities in relation to fandom. While there has been some diversification within the past decade or so, to my mind this remains very much the case even today. Where, say, black fandom has been discussed, it’s been primarily focused on hip hop and/or Afrofutursm, as if these cultural forms were co-extensive with black cultural identity. But this is far from being the case, as both the controversial but longstanding white fandom for hip hop or anime attest, as well as the even more longstanding black fandom for hardcore and punk music. For more on the latter, I recommend the excellent documentary Afro-Punk (dir. James Spooner, 2003). Other than such isolated studies, there remains considerable scope today for exploring the question of race in music fandom and in other fandoms beyond it.\n\nThe Bots, “Stop” (2010)\nThe second point is in relation to Daniel Cavicchi’s reference (p. 144) to the transcultural dimension of contemporary global fandom. While the most obvious contemporary example is the global fandom around K-pop, fandom was transcultural long before the viral success of “Gangnam Style”—consider for example the US fandom for Japanese anime since the 1970s, or conversely, the Japanese fandom for hip hop (not to mention countless other western musical styles and genres). Today, however, it’s undeniable that the global fandoms around K-pop and other elements of the “Korean Wave” are the best example that fandom has arguably always been transcultural.See Bertha Chin and Lori Hitchcock Morimoto, “Introduction: Fan and Fan Studies in Transcultural Context” in Participations: Journal of Audience and Reception Studies 12:2 (November 2015): 174-79.Roland Kelts, Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Has Invaded the U.S. (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006).Ian Condry, Hip-Hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2006).\nLast spring (perhaps like some of you), I visited the “Hallyu! The Korean Wave” exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which included an extensive section devoted to K-pop. Like the London exhibition that preceded it, the MFA exhibition was wildly successful, attracting large numbers of K-pop fans. Over the past decade, K-pop and the global fandoms swirling around it have been the subject of countless academic studies, and today it constitutes an academic subfield in its own right. At the time of writing, the K-pop rollercoaster shows no sign of slowing down: after three seasons of Netflix’s Squid Game, the runaway hit of the summer is a 3D animation movie that you might possibly have heard of called K-Pop Demon Hunters (2025). While the older transcultural fandoms for Japanese media products continue, they have long since been eclipsed by K-pop’s domination of transcultural pop fandom. What are we to make of all this? Why is it that K-pop seems to resonate with such culturally different audiences around the globe? These are questions that continue to be studied by transcultural fandom scholars today.The Boston exhibition originated in an exhibition in 2023 at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.\nAcademic studies of fandom have for too long remained focused largely on national cultural contexts, from Star Wars to Dr. Who. In the age of global streaming and social media platforms, however, it’s clear that music fandom has been transforming almost before our eyes, as global K-pop is joined by a host of other hybridized musical styles spawned by local fandoms for internationally circulating styles, from psychedelia to punk to heavy metal to EDM. Perhaps the biological phenomenon of spawning, indeed, may provide the best metaphor today for the musical ecosystems swarming around the globe, and the fandoms that sustain them. In such an environment, there’s no knowing what may be the next thing to crawl out of the pond, but the next generation of Demon Hunters will surely be waiting for it.",

    "text": "I wanted to introduce you to Allissa Richardson’s book Bearing Witness While Black for a number of reasons.\n\nBecause I think it’s one of the most important books on social media to come out in recent years;\nBecause of its conceptual richness and utility in providing a systematic framework for understanding the role of social media as a platform for witnessing.\nAs a reminder that social media is not just about marketing and entertainment, but is also a political practice, specifically in this case in relation to the politics of identity.\nTo provide a framework for thinking about race in relation to social media.\nBecause it’s extremely relevant to a social justice struggle that’s still going on in the US right now. Two years ago in Denver, there was another incident similar to those described in Alissa Richardson’s book, involving video and social media; ironically, the black 14-year old shot by police has the same name as the author of the book itself: Richardson.\n\nAcross the two chapters, various older analytical frameworks for witnessing are referenced, but I think that Richardson makes a compelling case for the historical specificity of Black witnessing in particular (I didn’t assign chapter 2, but that covers the historical part, in terms of the role of early Black newspapers, etc.).\n\n\nOne of the most important concepts that’s introduced is the notion of the public sphere, and of Black public spheres in particular, I remember reading the special issue of the journal Public Culture, “The Black Public Sphere,” when it came out in 1994. \nThe concept of the public sphere itself remains very relevant today, particularly in the context of social media, and I was wondering whether you’d come across the concept in any previous classes, as well as what you thought of the concept of counterpublics that Richardson elaborates.\nAs you’ll have seen if you read it, the first part of chapter 3 focuses primarily on the interviews with participants in Black Lives Matter and other activists. Among these, the work of the data scientist Samuel Sinyangwe is particularly interesting. He is definitely worth following on Twitter, and check out his current project, Police Scorecard.\n\n\n\nIn terms of concepts, the latter part of the chapter frequently references the concepts of news frames, which are to do with the crucial concept of representation. Both Black Lives Matter and Richardson are engaged in critiquing the existing dominant news frames of legacy media (I love the use of this term legacy media to describe old-school news networks like Fox or CNN! It makes them seem so out of touch with what’s happening on the ground.)\nOne key theoretical concept that’s mentioned a few times by Richardson is the notion of the white racial frame, a term first elaborated by Joe Feagin in his 2013 book of the same name. Essentially, all of the legacy news frames discussed by Richardson (from Wolf Blitzer on down…) are examples of Feagin’s concept. I’m attaching the Preface and Introduction to Feagin’s book here in case you’re interested in reading them.\nHow events such as police beatings or shootings of unarmed black citizens is framed, in terms of what kind of story is told about those events and who tells it, is the key political issue in relation to news frames. The question then is, whose frame is the dominant one? What emerges clearly from Richardson’s book is that the Black appropriation of social media platforms such as Twitter has served to challenge and destabilize the historical hegemony of the white racial frame in legacy news media outlets, often exposing their distortions and biases.\nIn her book Twitter and Tear Gas, the Turkish journalist Zeynep Tufekci has also explored this socially progressive dimension of social media platforms in relation to resistance movements in the Middle Eastern region, particularly the Arab Spring in Egypt and Tunisia in 2011, as well as resistance movements in Turkey. That’s a separate topic though, which we can explore later in the course if people are interested in going further down that road.Zeynep Tufekci, Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protes (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2017).\n\nTo finish for this week, here are some additional materials relating to Black witnessing in particular that will be of interest. I highly recommend the video interview with Allissa Richardson below, while the articles about Tyre Nichols earlier this year also raise complex questions about the ethical issues raised by the increasing circulation and visibility of videos on social media platforms, whether by citizen journalists, CCTV footage, or police body cameras. The question about our social/political responsibility to watch these often extremely disturbing videos (from Rodney King to Tyre Nichols) is a key subject of debate right now. As Allissa Richardson puts it in the interview below:\n\nI would like to get to the point where we don’t need the videos to believe black people […] Why are black people asked to produce this footage to kind of pre-litigate the fact that they didn’t deserve their own demise?\n\n–Allissa Richardson, quoted in Mirna Wabi-Sabi, “Lula and the Yanomami: Uproar Over Photos in Brazil,” plataforma9, 25 January 2023.\n\nHistorical witnessing: Travelling While Black (2019) (VR documentary), available from the Meta store.\n\n\n\n\nSarah Smith, “Anger and hope for change at Tyre Nichols funeral” (BBC News, 2 February 2023).\nShira Ovide, “Do you have a moral duty to watch the police beating of Tyre Nichols?” (Washington Post, 31 January 2023).\nDavid Graeber, “Ferguson and the Criminalization of American Life” (Gawker, 15 March 2015).",

    "section": "",
    "text": "} \n\n\nW6: Aesthetics\n\n\nReadings:\nGuilherme Giolo and Michaël Berghman, “The Aesthetics of the Self: The Meaning-Making of Internet Aesthetics” (PDF) Aesthetics Wiki (read all articles in the section called “What Are Aesthetics?” and explore the site)\nI’m assuming that you’re all very familiar with the notion of an aesthetic, but I’m also assuming that you’re not familiar with thinking about it from an analytical standpoint. But that’s exactly what we’re going to do this week, and what this week’s reading assignments are about. I think we can all agree that the term itself has become ubiquitous in contemporary youth culture, yet the concept itself remains surprisingly undiscussed or debated within that same culture; it’s as if all of us already know exactly what the term itself refers to, so discussions tend to circulate around specific aesthetics rather than on what the term itself is referring to. As media scholars, however, scrutinizing such supposedly transparent terms is precisely what we are required to do. In this week’s reading assignments and lecture, I hope that you’ll discover that the term “aesthetic” is a lot more pervasive, and a lot more complex than you may have realized. I would go so far as to argue that it’s one of the most important concepts of our time because it provides a framework within which we construct our very sense of identity. But in today’s youth culture, this process works very differently from how it has done until quite recently.\nTake a very well-known aesthetic like cyberpunk. If you take a look at the entry on the Aesthetics Wiki, you’ll discover (and you may know already) that the term “cyberpunk” originated in the literary sphere, specifically a subgenre of science fiction that originated in the early 1980s in the fiction of male Anglo-American novelists such as William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, while a variant of cyberpunk that subsequently devloped in the fiction of Neil Stephenson and others became known as steampunk, an equally well-known aesthetic today. The point here is that even though both cyberpunk and steampunk started out as popular subgenres of literary science fiction, they are today much more than just that. From its inception, in fact, cyberpunk was never an exclusively literary genre, and along with William Gibson’s novel Neuromancer (1984) Ridley Scott’s noirish, science fiction film Blade Runner (Ridley Scott, 1982) has become synonymous with the genre. After Gibson’s film and Scott’s film, cyberpunk’s distinctive aesthetic became ubiquitous not just in other works of fiction and movies but also videogames and graphic novels, and today extends across the whole spectrum of contemporary media: no longer just a literary style, it’s a visual style (reprised in the recent sequel Blade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017)), a musical style (a derivative of the EDM genre synthwave), and a fashion style (cosplay); “Steampunk” is a popular Halloween outfit.\nDrawing on the older analytical framework of media semiotics, it’s of course interesting and fun to try to identify the the specific elements of the cyberpunk aesthetic. Of course, this isn’t limited to purely audiovisual elements and motifs—neon-drenched urban cityscapes at night, a heavily purple color palette, ambient electronic soundscapes inspired by the soundtrack of Blade Runner—but also characterization, plot structures, narrative themes, production design, costume design. Trying to define cyberpunk in this way quickly becomes a trickier task than it initially appears. Much the same argument could be made about other major aesthetics of our time, from goth to vaporwave. The point, though, is that even though aesthetics may originate in one particular medium, genre, or platform—literature, film, popular music, anime—they are no longer limited to any one of these but extend across them; this is, in fact, why they are more usefully defined as aesthetics. We’ve already seen a good example of this in the first week of classes, with the aesthetic of the Japanese Studio Ghibli, which as we have seen has its own distinctive aesthetic that has made it recognizable worldwide.\nYet it could also be suggested that as was the case with the historical cinematic genre known as film noir, cyberpunk, vaporwave, or Ghibli, their aesthetic is not just limited purely to their stylistic elements (visuals, music, etc.) or even their narratives or character design, but includes other elements that are a lot harder to define: a particular worldview, for example (nihilistic, humanistic, etc.); a particular sensibility or emotional register that can be expressed by two other key contemporary concepts: mood and vibe. Just as cyberpunk has its own particuar vibe, so too in a very dfferent way do Ghibli movies. What are the characteristics of this mood or vibe in either case, and what exactly do we mean by “vibe” in the first place? It’s another term that is worth thinking about. I won’t say any more about it here, but encourage you to reflect upon it in this week’s discussion forum.\nSo what, exactly, is an aesthetic? In what is to my knowledge the only academic source to date to have explored the concept of the aesthetic in theoretical terms, Giolo and Berghman (2024) suggest that traditional conceptual frameworks such as genre, lifestyle, or subculture are no longer adequate to understanding the contemporary modalities of cultural identity and creativity. Instead, they explore the concept of the “aesthetic” as the key component of a new analytical framework. What does an “aesthetic” in this contemporary sense consist of? One of the defining components of what Giolo and Berghman call Internet aesthetics is their association with certain kinds of experience, and the corresponding feelings evoked by the memory of that experience: the experience of living in the world of 1950s America, for example, or the world of Harry Potter; the experience of living in a dystopian future; or, one might add, the experience of living on the American West Coast in the 1970s, or in Tokyo at the height of the bubble economy. While music is a key component of such experiences, it is only one modality within a larger cultural world. Imaginatively speaking, aesthetics recall the fantasy worlds of videogames and LARPing:\n\nExperiences (and, likely, their importance for Internet aesthetics) seem to be even more evident in the titles of playlists associated with different aesthetics: “You are studying in a haunted library with ghosts” (dark academia playlist), “You found the entrance to a secret garden”, “You are falling for the protagonist in a fantasy novel” (light royaltycore), or “A playlist for old money living in the French countryside” (light academia). Even clearer here, multiple objects (songs) are grouped and given symbolic meaning under a new interpretive key. This key is experience-centered. Thus, it seems acceptable to assume that experience is also the goal of an Internet aesthetic: to become someone different, to feel as if living in a different time (2024). [Emphasis mine]\n\nGiolo and Berghman (2024) also emphasize the affective dimension of Internet aesthetics, and their interviewees frequently reference feelings when describing them:\n\n“The aesthetics that I like really depend on my mood of the day. On Sundays, when it’s sunny, I really enjoy aesthetic images that give me this summer feeling” Jane (Dutch, prefers “cottagecore”).\nJane, who strongly connects “cottagecore” to morning walks, went on to explain that in those moments the scenarios and imaginaries of this Internet aesthetic “flow” into her activity, representing “the things I would like at that moment. They give me a warming feeling” (2024). [Emphasis mine]\n\nBy now we are (hopefully) getting closer to understanding what it means to describe city pop as an aesthetic rather than just a musical genre. Like vaporwave, like future funk, like mallsoft, like lo-fi hip hop, city pop conjures up a particular kind of cultural-historical aesthetic experience and a corresponding affective structure, via playlists, imagery, and other elements. As has been much discussed in the case of vaporwave, the dominant temperamental register is nostalgic and melancholic, invoking a bygone era of economic optimism and technological utopianism rendered only more poignant by the harsh realities of the dystopian present.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDenis Villeneuve, dir. 2017.

    "section": "",
    "text": "W2: Ideology and the Orwellian\n\n\n\nReadings:\n\nLouis Althusser, “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses” (PDF)\nMark Fisher, “It’s Easier to Imagine the End of the World Than the End of Capitalism” (PDF)\nMark Fisher, “Lecture 1: What Is Postcapitalist Desire?” (PDF)\n\nThe notion of ideology is one of the most complex—and perhaps for that reason one of the most widely misunderstood—theoretical concepts. The usual entry points, such as Terry Eagleton’s book Ideology, can quickly overwhelm the newcomer with distinctions and definitions; Eagleton alone comes up with six different definitions of ideology by the end of the book’s opening chapter. More accessible introductions such as the Slovenian theorist Slavoj Žižek’s in Sophie Fiennes’s documentary The Pervert’s Guide to Ideology (2012) are recommended, but can also be quite confusing.\n\n\nI recommend the opening sequence, in which Žižek uses the example of the 1980s film They Live as an introduction to thinking about ideology.\n\nThe standard introductory text on ideology is the French Marxist theorist Louis Althusser’s chapter which I’ve assigned. It’s also not an easy read (this is theory, after all), but the section at the end about the process of what Althusser calls interpellation (aka “hailing”) as one of the key operations of ideology is a bit easier to understand. It’s related to the notion of subjectivity and Althusser’s key idea that ideology continually addresses us, and constructs our identities, as subjects, in the political sense of the term “subject” (people who are the subjects of a monarch, etc.). In other words, ideology isn’t just a set of ideas and values that we take for granted as “normal” or “natural” (which is part of it), but more fundamentally, it shapes our very sense of who we are, our sense of our own identity and its relation to the wider world; our subjectivity, in other words. One of the ways it does this is by what Althusser calls “interpellating” us–calling out to and addressing us as particular kinds of subjects. For example, within the ideology of capitalism (only one kind, but the dominant one within which we are all immersed and that frames our sense of identity unless we are, say, anarchists or communists), the institution of advertising interpellates us as subjects: that is, it continually and directly addresses us, calling upon us to participate in capitalism as responsible citizen-consumers by consuming a multitude of commodities (including of course media commodities) and services that keep markets for these commodities and/or commodified services ticking over and growing. On a more general level, advertising is based on and reproduces the basic assumption that capitalist exchange is a “normal” and “natural” practice.\nIt isn’t just advertising that interpellates us in this way, of course. Governments and their related institutions continually interpellate us as national citizens, in the direct address to us of political leaders, government representatives, the police, or news anchors. It’s no coincidence that Althusser’s example of interpellation involves a policemen calling out to us “Hey you!”. In different ways, all of the messages politicians and government institutions address to us do the same thing—here in the UK, for example, one of the most irritating messages that interpellates us constantly on trains, the subway, or at airports is “If you see something, say something” and its related slogan, “See it, Say It, Sorted”. This addresses “us” collectively as responsible national citizens united in our opposition to and struggle against unspecified “terrorist” others seeking to attack our society. Ideological interpellation is at its height during wartime (especially for recruitment: “England needs you!”), and persists in commodified form in the merchandise of “Keep Calm and ”.\nIf our subjectivity roughly corresponds to the mode of address of interpellation, we are likely to receive these ideological messages without a second thought; it’s only if you have a different kind of identity or subjectivity that you notice, for example if you are watching French news (assuming that you can understand French) as a non-French person.\nIdeology and its practice of interpellation arent’ just limited to the political or economic (capitalism) domains though. If you are a woman, especially a feminist, living in a patriarchal society, for example, you will no doubt notice (and feel alienated by) its continual interpellation of male heterosexual subjects and ignoring of women (“Hi guys!”). If you identify as non-binary, you will be in constant struggle with the oppressive heteronormativity and binarism of the dominant culture. If you are a vegan, you will notice the dominant ideology of meat-eating and how it continually assumes that it is the norm to which vegetarianism or veganism is the exception (although this of course has changed significantly in recent decades). But to white cisgender meat-eating heterosexuals (!!!), everything they do is “normal” because their identity is framed by their ideology that they remain unaware of it until it is pointed out to them. As Žižek points out, this is an uncomfortable process, since ideology is what to “us” (i.e. the people within a particular ideology) feels normal and natural. Having your ideology challenged by someone, or leaving it, is a painful process that forces you to leave your ideological “comfort zone”.\nWhat is your position on hunting animals? Did you grow up in a family that has routinely hunted animals for generations? Try discussing that with an animal-rights activist. This is a conflict not just between two different ideologies—in this case, an “anthropocentric” ideology that considers animals as inferior and not entitled to the kind of rights that humans have, and a “non-anthropocentric” ideology that contests this—but between two fundamentally different forms of identity and subjectivity. As this example shows, ideology is inseparable from language, or more specifically what Michel Foucault calls discourse (which you can think of as ideological language), and arguments about ideology are often arguments about language: “anthropocentric”, for example, is a relatively recent term that originates in the discourse of animals rights, precisely as a critique of anthropocentric ideology. On the other side of the political spectrum, the term “woke” is a term used by dominant social groups to frame efforts to challlenge their dominant position in political hierarchies and their control over the forms of representation that circulate within it.\nCapitalist Realism\nMark Fisher’s concept of capitalist realism, outlined in the introduction to his 2009 book of the same name, marks an attempt to identify an ideology produced within and about capitalism itself since the collapse of Eastern European communist dictatorships at the end of the 1980s. While the concept of capitalism itself of course originates in the much older discourse of Marxism, it’s the notion of realism that is the ideological core of the concept. “Realism”, in this context, is the apparently ideology-free assumption that in declaring that the fall of Communism demonstrates that—for all its faults—there is simply no alternative to capitalism, no other political-economic-social way of life outside it, one is simply being realistic; as if this was simply the reasonable conclusion that any rational person would reach. In fact, it’s precisely where such “rational” or “objective” explanations are invoked that we are most likely to be in the domain of ideology, since to invoke “reason” or “objectivity” is itself a deeply ideological move. In this case, the objective of the ideology is to ensure the continuation of the existing (capitalist) status quo by pre-emtively closing off any possibility of imagining any other ways of living beyond it. To do so, it can be argued, is in itself an inherently ideological move (since ideology always wants to assume that it is the “right way”), but also a political move.\nThe short section from Mark Fisher’s lecture about what he calls “postcapitalist desire” (or the lack thereof…) I think provides a mini-case study in the operations of capitalist realism and how it operates in contemporary media culture and is reproduced by it. The 1984 superbowl commercial is widely regarded as a classic event in the history of advertising, but to my knowledge has not been subjected to the kind of ideological analysis that Fisher gets into in those few pages. Anyway, here are the two 1984 commercials that he references in the lecture. Take a look at them and then (re)read the except from the lecture.\n\n\nReturning to what I was saying earlier about advertising and ideology, we can see that both the Apple and the Levi’s commercials are interpellating “us” (we Americans in this case) as (consumer) subjects who they want to agree with the (capitalist-realist) worldview they present, in other words as people from the cool, colorful capitalist world rather than the bleak monochrome one of communist totalitarianism. Deep down, both commercials suggest, everybody wants Apple computers or Levis, even if totalitarian regimes deny them access to it. In fact, one can imagine a similar commercial being made today that frames North Koreans as “naturally” wanting to become part of consumerist South Korea.\nIn ideological terms, what’s interesting about the Apple commercial in particular is how advertising itself is invoking “ideology” as it is commonly framed by capitalist realism, as something that equates George Orwell’s classic dystopian novel 1984 with Eastern-European totalitarianism (declining but still very much alive when the commercial was made, of course). What’s interesting in this case, though, is how Apple is sort of mapping the political distinction between totalitarian conformity and revolutionary freedom onto its own relationship to its economic competitor, Microsoft: most explicitly in the resemblance between the bespectacled Great Leader on the screen and Bill Gates! So Apple is in a way co-opting the visual language of political revolution as a marketing strategy by positioning its competitor as a “boring”, autocratic regime being overthrown by a “revolutionary” insurgent (ie. Apple). This has become a common strategy in advertising and promotional culture, where “Revolution” is often coopted in branding and marketing (consider MTV’s 1980s slogan, “Revolution™”).\nMany similar examples could be found today. A particularly interesting example is the graphic artist Shepard Fairey’s iconic poster of Barack Obama that became ubiquitous in Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign:\n\nPrior to the Obama poster, Fairey was better known as the creator of the André the Giant “Obey” poster (see image above). The “Obey” poster can in fact be seen as an early example of advertising’s coopting (in ideological terms this is called “recuperation”) and commodification of the visual iconography of totalitarianism itself, along with its counterpart, revolution, in the endless variations on the iconography of the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-Tung or the Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara. Shepard Fairey has converted his propaganda-inspired images into a highly successful brand.\nOne can, of course, find innumerable examples of such “post-Communist” capitalist realism in everyday media culture. Even the dreary architectural realities of 1970s Communist architecture and everyday life have today been reified (turned into commodities) objects of nostalgia in []“post-Soviet” aesthetics](https://www.nssmag.com/en/fashion/24757/post-soviet-aesthetic).\nMeanwhile, streaming platforms such as Netflix are awash in hugely popular drama series that are allegedly also examples of what Fisher calls capitalist realism. Paradoxically, capitalist dystopias are among the most popular forms of commercial entertainment. A case in point is arguably the hugely-successful Korean series Squid Game, a show that while ostensibly a satirical critique of the social and economic injustices of capitalism (notably its system of debt), arguably serves to reinforce the ideological idea of the inescapability of capitalism itself: in the world of Squid Game as in so many other similarly “anti-capitalist” series and movies, there is simply No Alternative.",

    "text": "Readings:\n\nDiane Negra and Yvonne Tasker, “Introduction: Feminist Politics and Postfeminist Culture” (PDF)\nMartin Roberts, “The Fashion Police: Governing the Self in What Not To Wear” (PDF)\n\nSherrie Levine, President Collage: 6, 1979\n\n\nAlong with fields such as semiotics, Marxist political economy, psychoanalysis, and postmodern(ist) theory, since the 1970s feminist theory and its many offshoots has emerged as one of the most influential critical frameworks in film and media anaylsis. “Feminist theory” here encompasses a wide range of gender-based theoretical approaches, from the common historical framework (first-wave, second-wave, third-wave) to postfeminism, cyberfeminism, and its most recent iteration, xenofeminism. What these diverse approaches have in common is an analysis of the repressive political, social, and economic structures of modern patriarchy, their historical subjection of women both in everyday life and media representations, and the project of emancipating women from them which continues into the present.\nI don’t have a lot of time to get into the details of postfeminism here, which has become one of the most popular but also one of the most widely critiqued currents within feminism since the 1980s. For that, I will simply refer you to the excellent introduction to Yvonne Tasker and Diane Negra’s influential anthology Interrogating Postfeminism from the early 2000s. The accompanying reading assignment to it, my own article on fashion makeover shows in lifestyle television, provides a case study in what I saw as one of the most striking popular implementations of postfeminist ideology at the time, the British (and subsequently American show What Not To Wear). Although dating from almost two decades ago now, my analysis of the show may perhaps bring to mind some more contemporary examples, as well as encouraging us to reflect on and discuss what has become of “postfeminism” several decades on. I’m curious to hear your thoughts on that, and have some thoughts of my own about it which I lay out below.\n\n\n\n\n\n To do what I should do\nTo long for you to hear\nI open up my heart\nAnd watch her name appear\nA word for you to use\nA girl without a cause\nA name for what you lose\nWhen it was never yours (oh-oh do-do-do)\n. . .\nA name the girl outgrew\nThe girl was never real\nShe stands for your abuse\nThe girl is no ideal\nIt’s a word for what you do\nIn a world of broken rules\nShe found a place for you\nAlong her chain of fools (oh-oh do-do-do)\n—David Gamson, Green Gartside [Scritti Politti], “The Word Girl” (1985) \n\n\nSee the course YouTube playlist for other examples of “girl” pop songs.\n\nEveryone is female, and everyone hates it.\n—Andrea Long Chu, Females (2018)\n\n\nGirl’s gotta eat.\n—Alex Quicho, “Everyone is a Girl Online”\n\nFrom the standpoint of feminist theory, one possible starting point for critically engaging with contemporary constructions of female identity is the current ubiquity of the word girl, and debates about it, in the polyphonic discourses swirling across social media. Perhaps the key observation here appears to be the displacement of the feminist term woman itself by the ubiquitous girl, as well as the equally ubiquitous use of female—as a noun rather than an adjective—as theorized in Andrea Long Chu’s influential book Females (2018).\nThe term girl has in recent decades become an object of increasing theoretical interest, notably in a much-debated work by the French Tiqqun collective, Preliminary Materials for a Theory of the Young Girl (1999, Eng. trans. 2012).\nThe collective argue that in postmodernist society and its accompanying digital culture, the identity of the “girl” has become inseparable from commodity culture and mass consumption. Andrea Long Chu goes even further, attempting in her book to disarticulate the term female from its connection either to anatomical biology or constructions of gender identity, framing it instead simply as a structural position of subservience and subjection. From this point, even biological men can be framed as “female”. In her controversial WIRED article, feminist theorist and cosplayer Alex Quicho draws on both Tiqqun’s and Andrea Long Chu’s texts to elaborate the audacious and apparently counterintuitive claim that “Everyone is a Girl Online”. Chu’s project of disarticulating femininity both from anatomy and gender seems vindicated in the ubiquitous social media trend of the babygirl, a biologically male but adorably tearful “sad girl” embodied by Kendall Roy from HBO’s series Succession or Pedro Pascal in… well, pretty much anything.\n\n\nAlex Quicho, “Everyone is a Girl Online” (WIRED, 11 September 2023)Emma Copley Eisenberg, “Notes on Frump: A Style for the Rest of Us” (heyalma, 10 August 2017)\nContrary to postfeminist enthusiasts of online girldom, we have Emma Copley Eisenberg’s critique of what she calls the Sexy Adult Woman [SAW] ideal through her defence of what she calls Frump, a modality of female identity deliberately oppositional to the patriarchal imperative of appealing to the cisgender male gaze. Inspired by Susan Sontag’s famous essay “Notes on Camp”, Eisenberg’s article “Notes on Frump: A Style for the Rest of Us” makes a compelling case for a form of contemporary womanhood in opposition both to the Young Girl and her grown-up counterpart, the SAW.\n\n\n\nA second starting-point for thinking about female identity in the contemporary world is to do with motherhood and reproductive rights. The contemporary theorists that I would direct you to in this area would be Helen Hester, Joanna Zylinska, Bogna Konior, and the xenofeminists members of the Laboria Cubotniks collective, authors of the Xenofeminist Manifesto. Representing perhaps the most radical current within contemporary feminist thought, the xenofeminist group developed out of the cyberfeminism of Donna Haraway’s Cyborg Manifesto. In keeping with Haraway’s figure of the cyborg as a kind of ideal for women’s engagement with technology, the xenofeminist group (as far as I understand it) embrace technology in the broadest sense for its potential for liberating women from their traditional role of domestic reproduction and caregiving.For an introduction to Haraway’s work and the concept of the cyborg, see Ezra Winton’s article Revisiting the Cyborg Manifesto\nWith regard to media criticism and the critical frameworks mentioned above, it is interesting to look at representations of the mother in contemporary film and digital media culture, from the sardonic stereotypes of “soccer moms” and “mom jeans” to depictions of maternal agency in cinema, such as Korean director Bong Joon-ho’s 2009 thriller Mother. Perhaps you can think of some other examples that would be relevant to this discussion?\n\n\n\nTo conclude, here is a list of what we might think of as a collection of (often contradictory) modalities of female identity in contemporary social media culture, laid out as a word cloud.

    "text": "Department of Visual & Media Arts\nEmerson College\nSummer 2025\nWed 2 July—Wed 20 August (7 weeks) Online/asynchronous\nDr. Martin Roberts\n |  |  | \nCanvas site\nYouTube playlist\n\nCommunication plan:\nThe best way to reach me is by emailing me (martin_roberts@emerson.edu) and I will respond within 12 to 24 hours upon receiving your email message.\nI am also available for zoom meetings. Please email me with your meeting requests and available windows.\nZoom Office Hours: by appointment\nhttps://emerson.zoom.us/j/96415591363 (Passcode: 923351)\n\n\nThis online, asynchronous course examines approaches to the analysis and criticism of contemporary media. You will learn how to become critical of the media messages you use and create, and how to think and write with agency.\nThere are two components of this course:\n\nA survey of such critical approaches/methods as semiotics (Eco 1986; Barthes 1972), psychoanalysis, genre studies, feminist theories (Negra and Tasker 2007), cultural studies (Hall 1980), and postmodernism (Baudrillard 1994; Jameson 1991);\nThe application of these approaches to examining and critiquing various media forms and contents. We will spend a major part of this semester building up theoretical/methodological foundation while devoting the remaining to the critique and analysis of specific media texts and contexts.\n\nThrough extensive reading, writing, class discussion and screening, you will begin to develop the ability to analyze and critique popular media messages and images (Mulvey 1975), as well as develop a critical worldview informed by contemporary media theory (Fisher 2009).\n\n\n\nBy the end of the course, students should be able to:\n\nIdentify a variety of critical and theoretical approaches to the media\nDevelop and refine critical reading strategies, both in terms of the media and writings about the media\nCultivate a suitable academic vocabulary and the ability to write, think and create from a critical perspective\nAppreciate an ethically-based and de-centered global perspective on media form and function, sensitive to the work of minority critics and theorists under-represented in the canons of media criticism\nApply theory to practice, and engage with contemporary media production and consumption as critically aware media artists\n\n\n\n\nMark Fisher, Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative? (Winchester, UK, and Washington, USA: Zero Books, 2009).\nAllissa V. Richardson, Bearing Witness While Black: African Americans, Smartphones, and the New Protest #Journalism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020).\nSupplementary readings, available on Canvas (see bibliography).\n\n\n\nSchedule\nThe course begins on Wednesday 2 July and ends on Tuesday 19 August. Each week of the course accordingly begins on a Wednesday and ends on the following Tuesday.\nLectures, Discussion Forums, and Weekly Response Posts\nEach week, I will post a lecture, either in textual or video format, usually by Friday of the week in question.\nIn the lecture, I will assume that you have done the reading assignments for the week, so make sure to complete them before reading (or watching) the lecture.\nThe lecture will typically introduce some relevant examples relating to the readings that we can use as a starting point for the week’s discussion. However, you are also very welcome to suggest examples of your own that may come to mind after reading the course materials and the lecture.\nEach week, your initial Response post is due no later than the last day of the week in question (i.e. Tuesday in this case). You are then required to post at least 2 follow-up responses to any other group members’ posts (or my own) during the subsequent week. The Discussion cycle for each weekly topic therefore extends over two weeks:\n\nBy the end of the first week (Tuesday): initial response post\nBy the end of second week (the following Tuesday): min. 2 follow-ups to other people’s posts\n\nDon’t sweat too much about meeting exact requirements for post length and frequency! The purpose is for us to have a lively, productive discussion of each week’s readings so keep that as your main goal. Forums will also stay open beyond the biweekly cycle so you can catch up with posts later if you have time.\nAssigned Readings\nPlan on reading every assignment as listed on the course calendar. Since the reading will both inform and enhance material covered during class, please complete the reading assignments prior to watching the lecture videos.\nAttendance and Participation\nFull participation in class discussions and timely submission of all assignments constitutes evidence of class attendance. Students are expected to allocate sufficient time to complete all the requirements for each module: reading, viewing, responding to discussion questions, submitting replies to classmates, and completing other assignments on time. Failure to keep up with the pace of the course may result in lower grades or the failure of the class.\nDiscussion Forums and Weekly Response Posts\nEach week you are required to post a response of approximately 100-250 words to the course readings and/or the weekly lecture. The purpose of this assignment is for you to reflect on lectures, reading assignments or media clips and to pose questions. Along with your initial post, you are also required to respond to at least two (2) of your peers’ comments. Response posts are usually due by the end of the week in question: in this case, since the course began on a Wednesday, posts will be due by the Tuesday of the following week.\nIndividual Papers\nEach of you will write two analytical papers, which are due on June 9 and July 7 respectively. For the second paper assignment, you have the option to do a creative project (instead of a paper) using either BCS or Postmodernism concepts. Detailed instructions of the assignments are posted on Canvas. Feel free to consult with me if you have questions about an assignment or think you need extra help.\nResponse Papers\nYou will write two response papers responding to assigned films (see syllabus) in the contexts of the assigned readings. Each response paper should be approximately 750-1,000 words in length (3-4 pages, double-spaced). Your grade depends on how well you analyze and critique the film and how well you incorporate the readings into your critique/analysis.\nThe grading scale for papers is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nThis is excellent scholarly work that could be published in a student film or media studies journal. It displays good structure (i.e., a strong original thesis statement and a logical development of points to follow), content (sound analysis and good research when applicable), and presentational skills (i.e., excellence in verbal, logical, and grammatical expression, as well as care in mechanical details such as spelling, typing, bibliography and footnote preparation, etc.). It also follows style and formatting rules. (A=95).\n\n\nB\nThis is good scholarly work that could be published in a student journal with some adjustments. It has minor problems in a couple of the aforementioned areas. (B=85)\n\n\nC\nThis work exhibits problems in several of the aforementioned areas or a major problem in one. (C=75)\n\n\nD\nThis work exhibits little understanding of the subject matter or paper requirements. It fails to follow rudimentary formatting and displays sloppiness in spelling, grammar and sourcing. (D=65)\n\n\nF\nThis work exhibits no understanding of the subject matter or paper requirements. It fails to follow rudimentary formatting and displays sloppiness in spelling, grammar and sourcing. (F=55)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not plagiarize. Plagiarism is using someone else’s work without giving them fair credit. Plagiarism and cheating will result in an “F” for the assignment.\n\n\n\nEmerson is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through the provision of reasonable accommodations, so that each student may fully participate in the Emerson experience. Student Accessibility Services (SAS) staff will be working remotely for the fall of 2020. If you have a disability that may require accommodations, please contact them at SAS@emerson.edu or at (617)824-8592 to make an appointment with an SAS staff member.\nStudents are encouraged to contact SAS early in the semester. Please be aware that accommodations are not applied retroactively.\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of all Emerson students to know and adhere to the College’s policy on plagiarism, which can be found at: http://www.emerson.edu/policy/plagiarism*. If you have any question concerning the Emerson plagiarism policy or about documentation of sources in work you produce in this course, speak to your instructor.\n\n\n\nEvery student in this class will be honored and respected as an individual with distinct experiences, talents, and backgrounds. Students will be treated fairly regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identification, disability, socio-economic status, or national identity.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Readings:\n\nDavid Welch, “The Conquest of the Masses” (PDF)\nUmberto Eco, “Towards a Semiological Guerrilla Warfare” (PDF)\n\nWhere to begin?\nOn the most fundamental level, the field of media today can be described as a site of struggle—or more accurately, as a multiplicity of sites of struggle: struggles over the representation and interpretation of real-world events; struggles over identity and whose voices are heard (and whose not); struggles over the political use of media, whether as a tool of corporate or state control, or resistance to it; struggles over ownership and property rights; struggles over media ethics; struggles over creativity and aesthetics; struggles over the environmental impact of media and communication technologies, and many more.\nPerhaps most importantly, though, today’s digital, networked media technologies and social media platforms are sites of struggle over meaning: over the often multiple, often contradictory meanings of media texts, practices, or rituals. The task of media criticism arguably begins with the question of meaning: what certain forms of cultural or media expression mean to different publics and audiences, and how meaning itself is not inherent or self-evident, but socially constructed by the often contradictory interpretations of different communities.\nWithin this larger, continually evolving field of meaning-making, media criticsm involves the analysis and decoding of media texts within specific interpretative frameworks, some of which we will be exploring in this course. They are drawn from a multiplicity of fields of knowledge in the humanities and social sciences, including linguistics (semiotics) (Eco 1986), literary theory (narrative), political economy (Marxism), psychoanalysis, social theory, feminism (Negra and Tasker 2007), ethnography, and cultural studies (Hall 1980).\nThe fact that the interpretations of the same media texts are frequently contradictory doesn’t mean that they are equivalent in value in a relativistic way. On the contrary, many of the historical and still ongoing struggles over media meangings are struggles over power—over whose media practice, whose interpretation, is the dominant or valid one. It is often the practices and intrepretations of the most dominant groups within a society, or between societies, that are held to be the most valid ones. But resistant intrepretations and practices are always present, even when repressed, and may challenge or destabilize those of dominant socio-political groups.\nA Contemporary Example: Ghiblification\nIf all this sounds very abstract, it is useful to begin with a concrete example that exemplifies many of the preceding points. The example that I propose we consider this week is a very recent media practice that first emerged last spring (2025) and quickly became a site of struggle in all of the ways described above. It relates to generative AI—already in itself a huge site of struggle over the past few years—and specifically the upgrade to OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool last spring that introduced a new affordance that quickly became nothing less than a global media phenomenon: the ability to convert any photograph into the distinctive visual style of the globally popular Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli, using only a simple textual request (e.g. “Convert this into a still from a Studio Ghibli movie”). As with all of meme culture, many of the hundreds (probably thousands) of images generated quickly spread across social media platforms.\nI expect that all of you may have come across the phenomenon at the time, since it was so ubiquitous, but you may have been less aware of its scale and the controversies sparked by many of the practices that emerged from it. In case you missed it, though, and to get a sense of the scale of the phenomenon, take a look at this slideshow that I put together at the time.\nAmong the wildfire of controversies generated by the AI-Ghibli phenomenon, perhaps the most unexpected–often shocking–was its use use in political and indeed geopolitical contexts. To the outcry of many, even the White House appropriated the trend as part of its clampdown on immigration by posting a Ghiblified image on its official Instagram feed. But this was not an isolated event: take a look at this Twitter thread about the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\nAs you can see from the initial posts on the thread, it appears that the posting of Ghiblified photographs relating to the Gaza conflict was initiated by the Israeli Defence Force, but if you continue scrolling you will see that the practice was also used by pro-Palestinian or anti-Zionist sources. Just scrolling through this feed alone, I think you can see what I meant earlier by describing media as a site of struggle.\nWhile this may seem like a particularly complex example, I would argue that it’s actually quite typical of the complexities of contemporary media culture and the challenges it poses to the analysis of that culture. Within meme culture alone, one need only consider the strange afterlife of the Pepe The Frog meme, which was the subject of the documentary Feels Good Man (dir. Arthur Jones, 2020). If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend that you watch it, as it’s extremely relevant to our course!\nAs a cultural and political practice, media criticism sets out to make sense of all of this. How does it do this? What kinds of frameworks would enable us to understand examples such as the AI-Ghibli phenomenon or the alt-right’s political appropriation of the Pepe The Frog meme in the lead-up to the 2016 US election? Who would have thought that the charming visual style of Studio Ghibli’s much-loved films, many directed by the self-professed pacifist Hayao Miyazaki, would be appropriated as what appears to be a contemporary form of propaganda? Why would the White House, the IDF, or other political actors appropriate that style? What are they trying to communicate by doing so? I leave you to consider such questions, and am curious to hear what you think.\nIf you were wondering, then, why I assigned you to read one of the early chapters from Welch (1993) study of propaganda in the Third Reich, or Eco (1986) chapter on what he calls “semiological guerrilla warfare”, then by now you may have a better understanding why. Even though Eco’s concept dates from the early 1980s, the AI-Ghibli images amply demonstrate that the age of social media, still several decades away at the time, is today very much a field of semiological guerrilla warfare—not just a war in the human sense but also a war of signs: the signs in question being the existing global cultural mythology of Studio Ghibli itself, which is appropriated in different contexts and for different political purposes as a kind of second-order ideological language. This appropriation of an existing corpus of signs within (global) culture is one of the fundamental practices of what Barthes (1972) called “Mythologies” in his 1957 book of the same name: the process by which ideology presents itself as “normal” or “natural” rather than historical and dependent on highly unequal political, economic, and social dynamics.\nA wider question raised by the examples I’ve been discussing are about the nature of propaganda itself. What exactly is “propaganda”? Welch (1993) offers some useful starting points for reflecting on this subject, and its relevance to contemporary geopolitical contexts. If you’re interested in exploring this subject further, you’ll certainly need to watch Leni Riefenstahl’s film Triumph of the Will (1935), regarded as the classic text of the Nazi propaganda machine. It still makes for chilling viewing today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarthes, Roland. 1972. Mythologies. Translated by Annette Lavers.

As arguably the most influential cultural movement of the past half century, it’s almost inescapable today, ubiquitous across the spectrum of the arts, from Warhol to Jeff Koons, Twin Peaks to Stranger Things, Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction to Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs—okay that’s enough, I could go on for the entire lecture…\nBut what exactly is postmodernism? When did it start? And has it ended yet? In keeping with my approach in the course thus far, rather than plunging into dense theoretical texts, we will explore postmodernist aesthetics through some representative examples—in this case the works of the U.S. artist Cindy Sherman and the more recent Argentinian artist Amalia Ulman.\nSince there simply isn’t sufficient space here to explore all of the many facets of postmodernism, some basic distinctions and pointers will have to suffice. For a deeper dive, your starting point should probably be Fredric Jameson’s influential essay, “Postmodernism or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism”, followed by his book; or the French social theorist Jean Baudrillard’s classic book Simulacra and Simulations. But you don’t have to start with either of these texts. The first book I read on postmodernism was actually about architecture, Charles Jenks’s book The Language of Postmodernist Architecture, which has some illuminating discussion of the differences between modernist and postmodernist architecture.\nAn initial distinction is useful between postmodernism, which refers to an aesthetic movement extending across the spectrum of the arts, and postmodernity, a broader term that refers to a general condition (the reference points here being Jean-François Lyotard’s influential book The Postmodern Condition and David Harvey’s The Condition of Postmodernity) of society that has come to characterize the experience of global societies in the second half of the twentieth century and the first part of the twenty-first. I’m not going to get into the nature of postmodernity here, but suffice to say that postmodernism in the arts can be thought of as the artistic and cultural counterpart of the conditon of postmodernity itself.\nWhat follows can be considered a kind of “Postmodernism 101” that assumes that you know very little about postmodernism at the outset, and suggests some lines of inquiry to follow if you’re interested in exploring it in more depth.\nSo what do the diverse group of artists mentioned so far—Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, David Lynch, Quentin Tarantino, Jeff Koons, Wes Anderson, Amalia Ulman, and many more—have in common, aesthetically speaking?\nWhile people who have tried to define postmodernism agree that it can mean many different things, most would agree that one of its defining characteristics is pastiche, or what Fredric Jameson called “blank parody”. Pastiche here refers to the mimicry of particular historical styles, irrespective of the artistic field in question—painting, architecture, cinema, television, music, comics, and so on.\nConsider, for example, the image at the top of this page, Madonna by the Chilean artist Claudio Bravo. At first glance, you might easily mistake it for a Renaissance painting, in terms of its apparently religious subject matter, the vaguely biblical background that recalls religious illustrated books, and the symmetrical composition. The figure on the left pierced with arrows, for example, recalls the Christian martyr St. Sebastian, the subject of numerous Renaissance paintings. It might come as a surprise, then, to learn that the painting is a contemporary one (1979). The image first came to my attention in the early 1990s when it was used on the cover of an album by the Ensemble Alcatraz, Visions and Miracles (1988), a vocal group specializing in medieval and early modern music based in the San Franciso Bay area. The label website describes the album thus:\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula in the 13th century was home to a great exchange of cultures. One result: the cantiga, a combination of old and new musics from Christian, Muslim, and Jewish sources that told stories of adventure, calamity, and redemption, here brought to life by the Ensemble Alcatraz.\n\nIn Claudio Bravo’s pastiche of Renaissance painting, and the Ensemble Alcatraz’s eclectic pastiches of 13th-century Iberian music, we are already deeply immersed in postmodernist aesthetics. One of the characteristics of postmodernist painting is a return to figurative representation, in reaction against the abstraction that was one of the hallmarks of modernist painting, from the geometric minimalism of Mondrian to the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock.\nOne could spend a lot of time exploring postmodernist aesthetics simply within painting, from the 1960s “Pop Art” of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein to more recent examples. Both of these artists exemplify another key principle of postmodernist aesthetics: the embrace of popular media such as comics and the mass-cultural imagery of advertising, collapsing the modernist hierarchy between “high” (avant-garde) art and the “low” art (kitsch) of consumer mass culture.\nRather than painting, a particularly interesting starting point for exploring postmodernist aesthetics is photography. The 1970s saw the emergence of a number of female artists whose work engaged in different ways with photography as a means of elaborating a new, postmodernist aesthetics. They included Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, Sherrie Levine, or Sandy Skoglund (I leave you to Google any of these), but the two artists that I’m going to discuss today are of particular interest because of how their photographic work engages with the cinematic (Cindy Sherman) and social media (Amalia Ulman).\n\nCindy Sherman\nCindy Sherman is best known for her series of photographs (I think there are over 70 in all) dating from the late 1970s (1977-80) in which she elaborately stages stereotypical female roles that look uncannily like they are film stills from popular movies—the only difference being that the movies in question don’t exist. The main image for the course syllabus is a collage of some of the best-known of these photographs. Take a closer look at it, and click on the image to find out more about the series.\n\nSo what is “postmodernist” about this project? First, and related to the earlier discussion, because as the title of the series itself (Untitled Film Stills) makes clear, the photographs pastiche (that is, mimic or imitate) the visual style of the film still as a media format often seen in newspapers, magazines, and promotional matierals (such as film posters). In addition to the photographs’ formal mimicry of the film still, moreover, they also pastiche the visual style of popular films genres often problematized for their stereotypical portrayals of women, notably the well-known femme fatale stereotype of 1940s-1950s film noir. Some of Cindy Sherman’s photographs can be seen as pastiching the visual codes of film noir, most obviously in her decision to shoot on black-and-white film stock, reproducing the monochromatic look that is one of the most striking visual characteristics of film noir. It should be remembered that while the default film stock for photographers (especially photojournalists) well into the 1960s was black and white, even though shooting in color had been technically possible long before then, by the 1970s color had so become the norm that to choose to shoot in black and white already lent a retro that has become one of the hallmarks of postmodernist aesthetics. Sherman’s decision to shoot in black and white, then, is another (easily overlooked) element of their stylistic pastiche of the monochromatic aesthetic both of film noir and historical photography.\nWhat’s so fascinating about Sherman’s film stills, though, is that even though some of them can be seen as stylistic pastiches of film noir, in many other photographs it’s far less clear which cinematic genre is the object of pastiche. While there’s often a strong visual sense of déjà vu, evoking a popular film of the 1950s or 1960s, they key point is the indeterminacy of the reference—the fact that we can’t identify the photograph with any specific historical film or film genre.\nThis brings us to another defining concept of postmodernist aesthetics: simulation. The concept was elaborated in several classic essays in the 1970s by the French social theorist Jean Baudrillard, notably in his book (mentioned earler) Simulacra and Simulations (1979). For Baudrillard, the postmodern world is dominated by what he calls simulacra (sing. “simulacrum”), a new form of representation that essentially reverses the hierarchical relationship between the model and the copy. Historically, in the history of art, the model—in the form of the original work of art—has always preceded the copy: there is only one Mona Lisa, even though there are thousands of copies of Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting. The age of what Baudrillard calls the simulacrum—the postmodernist age—is defined by the reversal of this hierarchy, by the ascendancy of copies without models (which is what Baudrillard means by simulacra). Whereas in the era of realism, what was still understood as the “real world” preceded representation of it (regardless of the medium—literature, painting, photography, cinema, TV), by the 1970s, Baudrillard argued, the relationship between the real and representation had reversed, or perhaps more accurately the distinction between the two had collapsed: henceforth, claimed Baudrillard, “reality” had become effectively indistinguishable from mass-media representations of it, or what he and the Italian semiotic theorist Umberto Eco called hyperreality.This is why the Mona Lisa has what Walter Benjamin calls aura, its historical uniqueness in space and time\nWe don’t need to go any further at this point to understand how the photography of Cindy Sherman, as well as many other artists like her in the 1970s, could be seen as an artistic commentary on the hyperrealist world that Baudrillard was describing. Sherman’s Film Stills photographs are also copies without models in the sense that what semiotic theorists would call their referent—the original film from which they are sourced—does not exist. They are what Baudrillard might call cinematic simulacra.\nOver the past few decades, Cindy Sherman has become increasingly revered as one of the most influential figures in the emergence of postmodernist aesthetics since the 1970s. Her photographic critique of stereotypical representations of women in popular cinema was part of the larger current of feminist critiques of patriarchal representation, from Laura Mulvey’s influential critique of the male gaze in her mid-1970s essay to Chantal Akerman’s groundbreaking film Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975). Sherman has continued her exploration of female representation right up to the present, and even has an Instagram account. An episode of the recent Netflix series Inventing Anna includes an episode in which characters discuss her work at a gallery retrospective, and includes a brief cameo by Sherman herself, wearing the same head-scarfed outfit that she wears in one of her original Film Stills photographs, essentially re-enacting her own earlier roleplay in the photograph. (Could it be any more postmodernist?!?). The inclusion of Sherman in the show could scarcely be more appropriate, given that its subject is Anna Sorokin, who conned luxury hotels and her wealthy New York socialite friends by masquerading as a German heiress called Anna Delvey–another stunningly postmodernist example of “representation” usurping the place of reality.\n\n\nAmalia Ulman\nCindy Sherman’s Instagram account (in fact, she has several) provides a link between her 1970s performance-art photography exploring female identity and the work of the social media artist Amalia Ulman, which can arguably be seen as continuing Sherman’s project in the twenty-first century domain of social media. If you read any of the articles about Ulman’s work linked to as this week’s reading assignments, you should by now have a good idea of how she fits into the larger framework of postmodernism that I have been sketching out in the preceding discussion. As with Sherman’s Film Stills, and as with a number of similar postmodernist feminist artists (the French artist Sophie Calle is another example), in her fake Instagram account Ulman fabricated a stereotypical female persona as an art project, exposing through the sexist comments of her male admirers the continuing pressure on young women to conform to the visual pleasure of the male gaze almost half a century since Laura Mulvey’s critique, and in spite of “postfeminist” celebrations of the power of female sexuality Ulman’s work can in fact be seen as developing such as critique through masquerade, photography, and social media platforms in a manner that continues the artistic critiques of so many other postmodernist feminist artists since the 1970s.\nJust as Cindy Sherman’s Film Stills project explored stereotypical representations of women in cinema, Amalia Ulman has recently gone a step further by directing her first feature film, El Planeta, that continues her exploration of representations of female identity in the social media age more directly in cinematic form. The film’s opening sequence again sees Ulman role-playing, this time posing as a call girl negotiating sexual and financial arrangements with a future client in what subsequently proves to be (like her Instagram persona) a pure fabrication that ruthlessly exposes the objectification of women in patriarchal society. The masquerades continue after this initial one, from her later (apparent) impersonation of an international designer to her later romantic roleplay in her date with the Asian guy that she meets in the gift shop. Both she herself and her mother (played, in fact, by Ulman’s own mother), it turns out, are engaged in role-playing a fantasy of a glamorous lifestyle that has no relation to their actual socio-economic status—a masquerade that is ultimately exposed in the mother’s arrest for shoplifting with which the film ends.\nIt’s worth noting, finally, that as with Cindy Sherman’s film stills, Ulman’s 2022 film is also in black and white, stylistically pastiching not film noir in this case but the French New Wave films of Jean-Luc Godard, Agnès Varda, or François Truffaut, many of which also engage with the problematic position of women in the French society of their time. It’s interesting in this regard to think about the relationship between El Planeta and Varda’s film Cléo from 5 to 7, or Godard’s film with Anna Karina, Vivre Sa Vie which explores themes similar to those in Ulman’s film. I leave you to think about those connections, but suffice to say that Ulman’s black-and-white pastiche of a New Wave film also attests to the legacy of postmodernist aesthetics half a century after Cindy Sherman’s iconic film stills.",
