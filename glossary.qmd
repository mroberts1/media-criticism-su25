## Introduction

This glossary provides definitions of key theoretical concepts covered in the first six weeks of VM200 Media Criticism. Each entry includes a comprehensive definition (50-200 words) and citations to relevant sources for further reading.

## A

### Aesthetics {#aesthetics}

The philosophical study of beauty, taste, and artistic value, particularly as it relates to media forms and visual culture. In digital contexts, aesthetics refers to curated visual styles and sensibilities that emerge on social media platforms (like "cottagecore" or "dark academia"), serving as identity markers and forms of cultural expression. These internet aesthetics function as vernacular theories of taste that help individuals construct and communicate their identities online.

## B

### Black Witnessing {#black-witnessing}

A form of counter-narrative activism where African Americans use smartphones and social media to document and share experiences of racial injustice, police brutality, and systemic racism. This practice transforms citizens into journalists who bear witness to events often ignored or misrepresented by mainstream media, creating alternative news ecosystems that challenge dominant narratives about race and power in America.

## C

### Capitalist Realism {#capitalist-realism}

Mark Fisher's concept describing the pervasive belief that capitalism is the only viable political and economic system, making it easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. This ideological framework naturalizes neoliberal capitalism as inevitable and unchangeable, infiltrating education, culture, and consciousness to the point where alternatives become literally unthinkable.

:::

### Connotation/Denotation {#connotation-denotation}

Fundamental semiotic concepts distinguishing between literal meaning (denotation) and associated cultural meanings (connotation). Denotation refers to the explicit, dictionary definition of a sign, while connotation encompasses the cultural, emotional, and ideological associations that signs carry within specific contexts. Media criticism examines how connotative meanings naturalize ideological messages.

## D

### Discourse {#discourse}

In Foucauldian terms, discourse refers to ways of constituting knowledge through language, social practices, and power relations. Discourses shape what can be said, who can speak, and what counts as true or false within specific historical contexts. Media discourses construct and regulate subjects, identities, and social realities through representational practices.

## F

### Fandom {#fandom}

Organized communities of enthusiasts who actively engage with media texts through creative production, interpretation, and social interaction. Fandom represents participatory culture where audiences become producers, creating fan fiction, art, videos, and other transformative works. Digital platforms have amplified fandom's visibility and influence on media industries.

:::

### Feminism/Postfeminism {#feminism-postfeminism}

Feminism encompasses political movements and critical theories advocating for gender equality and analyzing patriarchal power structures. Postfeminism represents a cultural sensibility suggesting feminism's goals have been achieved while simultaneously incorporating and depoliticizing feminist ideas, often emphasizing individual empowerment, choice, and consumption over collective action.

## H

### Hegemony {#hegemony}

Antonio Gramsci's concept describing how dominant groups maintain power through consent rather than coercion, securing leadership through cultural and ideological means. Media functions as a key site for hegemonic struggle, where dominant meanings are contested and negotiated rather than simply imposed.

## I

### Ideology {#ideology}

Systems of ideas, beliefs, and representations that structure our understanding of social reality. Althusser's theory emphasizes how ideology interpellates individuals as subjects through Ideological State Apparatuses (ISAs) like media, education, and religion, making dominant power relations appear natural and inevitable.

:::

### Interpellation {#interpellation}

Althusser's concept describing how ideology "hails" or addresses individuals, transforming them into subjects who recognize themselves in ideological representations. Media interpellates audiences through forms of address that position viewers as particular kinds of subjects with specific identities, desires, and social positions.

## P

### Paradigm/Syntagm {#paradigm-syntagm}

Semiotic concepts describing two dimensions of meaning-making. Paradigmatic relations involve selection from available alternatives (choosing one sign from a set of possible signs), while syntagmatic relations involve combination (how signs are arranged in sequence). These concepts reveal how media texts generate meaning through both choice and structure.

:::

### Pastiche {#pastiche}

A postmodern aesthetic practice involving imitation without satirical intent, creating blank parody that recycles past styles without critical distance. Unlike parody's mocking stance, pastiche represents "the random cannibalization of all the styles of the past" (Jameson), reflecting capitalism's commodification of history and culture.

:::

### Postmodernism {#postmodernism}

A cultural condition characterized by the breakdown of grand narratives, the collapse of high/low cultural distinctions, and the dominance of simulacra over reality. In media, postmodernism manifests through pastiche, intertextuality, self-reflexivity, and the hyperreal—where simulations become more real than reality itself.

:::

### Protest #Journalism {#protest-journalism}

Citizen journalism practices using hashtags and social media to document, disseminate, and organize around social justice issues. This form of activism transforms witnesses into journalists, creating alternative news networks that bypass traditional media gatekeepers and challenge official narratives about protests and police violence.

## S

### Semiotics/Semiology {#semiotics}

The study of signs and sign processes, examining how meaning is created, transmitted, and interpreted in communication systems. Media semiotics analyzes how visual, auditory, and textual signs combine to produce ideological meanings, revealing the constructed nature of media representations.

:::

### Semiological Guerrilla Warfare {#semiological-guerrilla-warfare}

Umberto Eco's concept of tactical media resistance through alternative interpretation of mass media messages. Rather than controlling media production, guerrilla semiology intervenes at the point of reception, teaching audiences to decode messages critically and subvert intended meanings.

:::

### Simulacra/Simulation {#simulacra}

Baudrillard's concepts describing how copies without originals (simulacra) create a hyperreality where simulation replaces reality. In media-saturated societies, simulations become autonomous, generating their own reality effects independent of any external referent—reality TV, Instagram performances, and virtual worlds exemplify this condition.

:::

### Subculture {#subculture}

Social groups distinguished by specific styles, values, and practices that differentiate them from mainstream culture. Digital platforms have transformed subcultural formation, enabling new forms of aesthetic tribes and micro-communities organized around shared sensibilities, from TikTok subcultures to Discord communities.
