    "text": "W1: Introduction: Sites of Struggle\n\n\n David Welch, “The Conquest of the Masses” (from The Third Reich: Politics and Propaganda (1993))\nUmberto Eco, “Semiological Guerrilla Warfare” (from Travels in Hyperreality: Essays, trans. William Weaver (San Diego: Harcourt, Inc., 1983))\nWhere to begin?\nOn the most fundamental level, the field of media today can be described as a site of struggle—or more accurately, as a multiplicity of sites of struggle: struggles over the representation and interpretation of real-world events; struggles over identity and whose voices are heard (and whose not); struggles over the political use of media, whether as a tool of corporate or state control, or resistance to it; struggles over ownership and property rights; struggles over media ethics; struggles over creativity and aesthetics; struggles over the environmental impact of media and communication technologies, and many more.\nPerhaps most importantly, though, today’s digital, networked media technologies and social media platforms are sites of struggle over meaning: over the often multiple, often contradictory meanings of media texts, practices, or rituals. The task of media criticism arguably begins with the question of meaning: what certain forms of cultural or media expression mean to different publics and audiences, and how meaning itself is not inherent or self-evident, but socially constructed by the often contradictory interpretations of different communities.\nWithin this larger, continually evolving field of meaning-making, media criticsm involves the analysis and decoding of media texts within specific interpretative frameworks, some of which we will be exploring in this course. They are drawn from a multiplicity of fields of knowledge in the humanities and social sciences, including linguistics (semiotics), literary theory (narrative), political economy (Marxism), psychoanalysis, social theory, feminism, ethnography, and cultural studies.\nThe fact that the interpretations of the same media texts are frequently contradictory doesn’t mean that they are equivalent in value in a relativistic way. On the contrary, many of the historical and still ongoing struggles over media meangings are struggles over power—over whose media practice, whose interpretation, is the dominant or valid one. It is often the practices and intrepretations of the most dominant groups within a society, or between societies, that are held to be the most valid ones. But resistant intrepretations and practices are always present, even when repressed, and may challenge or destabilize those of dominant socio-political groups.\nA Contemporary Example: Ghiblification\nIf all this sounds very abstract, it is useful to begin with a concrete example that exemplifies many of the preceding points. The example that I propose we consider this week is a very recent media practice that first emerged last spring (2025) and quickly became a site of struggle in all of the ways described above. It relates to generative AI—already in itself a huge site of struggle over the past few years—and specifically the upgrade to OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool last spring that introduced a new affordance that quickly became nothing less than a global media phenomenon: the ability to convert any photograph into the distinctive visual style of the globally popular Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli, using only a simple textual request (e.g. “Convert this into a still from a Studio Ghibli movie”). As with all of meme culture, many of the hundreds (probably thousands) of images generated quickly spread across social media platforms.\nI expect that all of you may have come across the phenomenon at the time, since it was so ubiquitous, but you may have been less aware of its scale and the controversies sparked by many of the practices that emerged from it. In case you missed it, though, and to get a sense of the scale of the phenomenon, take a look at this slideshow that I put together at the time.\nAmong the wildfire of controversies generated by the AI-Ghibli phenomenon, perhaps the most unexpected–often shocking–was its use use in political and indeed geopolitical contexts. To the outcry of many, even the White House appropriated the trend as part of its clampdown on immigration by posting a Ghiblified image on its official Instagram feed. But this was not an isolated event: take a look at this Twitter thread about the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\nAs you can see from the initial posts on the thread, it appears that the posting of Ghiblified photographs relating to the Gaza conflict was initiated by the Israeli Defence Force, but if you continue scrolling you will see that the practice was also used by pro-Palestinian or anti-Zionist sources. Just scrolling through this feed alone, I think you can see what I meant earlier by describing media as a site of struggle.\nWhile this may seem like a particularly complex example, I would argue that it’s actually quite typical of the complexities of contemporary media culture and the challenges it poses to the analysis of that culture. Within meme culture alone, one need only consider the strange afterlife of the Pepe The Frog meme, which was the subject of the documentary Feels Good Man (dir. Arthur Jones, 2020). If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend that you watch it, as it’s extremely relevant to our course!\nAs a cultural and political practice, media criticism sets out to make sense of all of this. How does it do this? What kinds of frameworks would enable us to understand examples such as the AI-Ghibli phenomenon or the alt-right’s political appropriation of the Pepe The Frog meme in the lead-up to the 2016 US election? Who would have thought that the charming visual style of Studio Ghibli’s much-loved films, many directed by the self-professed pacifist Hayao Miyazaki, would be appropriated as what appears to be a contemporary form of propaganda? Why would the White House, the IDF, or other political actors appropriate that style? What are they trying to communicate by doing so? I leave you to consider such questions, and am curious to hear what you think.\nIf you were wondering, then, why I assigned you to read one of the early chapters from David Welch’s study of propaganda in the Third Reich, or Umberto Eco’s chapter on what he calls “semiological guerrilla warfare”, then by now you may have a better understanding why. Even though Eco’s concept dates from the early 1980s, the AI-Ghibli images amply demonstrate that the age of social media, still several decades away at the time, is today very much a field of semiological guerrilla warfare—not just a war in the human sense but also a war of signs: the signs in question being the existing global cultural mythology of Studio Ghibli itself, which is appropriated in different contexts and for different political purposes as a kind of second-order ideological language. This appropriation of an existing corpus of signs within (global) culture is one of the fundamental practices of what the French literary theorist Roland Barthes called “Mythologies” in his 1957 book of the same name: the process by which ideology presents itself as “normal” or “natural” rather than historical and dependent on highly unequal political, economic, and social dynamics.\nA wider question raised by the examples I’ve been discussing are about the nature of propaganda itself. What exactly is “propaganda”? David Welch’s book on the Third Reich offers some useful starting points for reflecting on this subject, and its relevance to contemporary geopolitical contexts. If you’re interested in exploring this subject further, you’ll certainly need to watch Leni Riefenstahl’s film Triumph of the Will (1935), regarded as the class text of the Nazi propaganda machine. It still makes for chilling viewing today.",

    "text": "Department of Visual & Media Arts\nEmerson College\nSummer 2025\nWed 2 July—Wed 20 August (7 weeks) Online/asynchronous\nDr. Martin Roberts\n\nCommunication plan:\nThe best way to reach me is by emailing me (martin_roberts@emerson.edu) and I will respond within 12 to 24 hours upon receiving your email message.\nI am also available for zoom meetings. Please email me with your meeting requests and available windows.\nZoom Office Hours: By appointment\nzoom personal meeting ID: 342 985 0038\nzoom meeting invitation link: https://emerson.zoom.us/my/shujen?pwd=MkRkOHRTZWxlQXpuTFppY1FFQUFXdz09\nCourse Description\nThis online, asynchronous course examines approaches to the analysis and criticism of contemporary media. You will learn how to become critical of the media messages you use and create, and how to think and write with agency.\nThere are two components of this course:\n\n\nsurvey of such critical approaches/methods as semiotics, psychoanalysis, genre studies, feminist theories, cultural studies and postmodernism;\n\n\napplication of these approaches to examining and critiquing various media forms and contents. We will spend a major part of this semester building up theoretical/methodological foundation while devoting the remaining to the critique and analysis of specific media texts and contexts.\n\n\nThrough extensive reading, writing, class discussion and screening, you will begin to develop the ability to analyze and critique popular media messages and images, as well as develop a critical worldview.\nStudent Learning Objectives\nBy the end of the course, students should be able to:\n\nIdentify a variety of critical and theoretical approaches to the media\nDevelop and refine critical reading strategies, both in terms of the media and writings about the media\nCultivate a suitable academic vocabulary and the ability to write, think and create from a critical perspective\nAppreciate an ethically-based and de-centered global perspective on media form and function, sensitive to the work of minority critics and theorists under-represented in the canons of media criticism\nApply theory to practice, and engage with contemporary media production and consumption as critically aware media artists\n\nRequired Texts\nMark Fisher, Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative? (Winchester, UK, and Washington, USA: Zero Books, 2009).\nAllissa V. Richardson, Bearing Witness While Black: African Americans, Smartphones, and the New Protest #Journalism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020).\nSupplementary readings, available on Canvas (see bibliography).\nCourse Structure and Requirements\nVideo Lectures\nEach week I will post video lectures on Canvas. The number of video lectures per week varies depending on each week’s topics.\nAssigned Readings\nPlan on reading every assignment as listed on the course calendar. Since the reading will both inform and enhance material covered during class, please complete the reading assignments prior to watching the lecture videos.\nAttendance and Participation\nFull participation in class discussions and timely submission of all assignments constitutes evidence of class attendance. Students are expected to allocate sufficient time to complete all the requirements for each module: reading, viewing, responding to discussion questions, submitting replies to classmates, and completing other assignments on time. Failure to keep up with the pace of the course may result in lower grades or the failure of the class.\nWeekly Assignment & Discussion\nPost-lecture discussions: Each week you are required to respond to questions or discussion prompts pertaining to that week’s course material, or to find a media example to illustrate a concept. The purpose of this assignment is for you to reflect on video lectures, reading assignments or media clips and to pose questions. Posts should be around 200 words. Along with your initial post, you are also required to respond to at least two (2) of your peers’ comments. This assignment is due at 5pm on most Sundays (responses to your peers’ posts are due by 5pm Monday). Other assignment details and prompts will be posted on canvas.\nIndividual Papers\nEach of you will write two analytical papers, which are due on June 9 and July 7 respectively. For the second paper assignment, you have the option to do a creative project (instead of a paper) using either BCS or Postmodernism concepts. Detailed instructions of the assignments are posted on Canvas. Feel free to consult with me if you have questions about an assignment or think you need extra help.\nResponse Papers\nYou will write two response papers responding to Gone Girl and Paris Is Burning in the contexts of the assigned readings. Each response paper is one single spaced page long (roughly 500-600 words). Your grade depends on how well you analyze and critique the film and how well you incorporate the readings into your critique/analysis.\nThe grading scale for papers is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nThis is excellent scholarly work that could be published in a student film or media studies journal. It displays good structure (i.e., a strong original thesis statement and a logical development of points to follow), content (sound analysis and good research when applicable), and presentational skills (i.e., excellence in verbal, logical, and grammatical expression, as well as care in mechanical details such as spelling, typing, bibliography and footnote preparation, etc.). It also follows style and formatting rules. (A=95).\n\n\nB\nThis is good scholarly work that could be published in a student journal with some adjustments. It has minor problems in a couple of the aforementioned areas. (B=85)\n\n\nC\nThis work exhibits problems in several of the aforementioned areas or a major problem in one. (C=75)\n\n\nD\nThis work exhibits little understanding of the subject matter or paper requirements. It fails to follow rudimentary formatting and displays sloppiness in spelling, grammar and sourcing. (D=65)\n\n\nF\nThis work exhibits no understanding of the subject matter or paper requirements. It fails to follow rudimentary formatting and displays sloppiness in spelling, grammar and sourcing. (F=55)\n\n\n\nLate Assignments\nAll late papers automatically lose one letter grade*! After two (calendar) days, loss of two letter grades. After three days, no credit. Exceptions, unless truly serious, will not be made.\nAcademic Honesty\nDo not plagiarize. Plagiarism is using someone else’s work without giving them fair credit. Plagiarism and cheating will result in an “F” for the assignment.\nDisability Statement\nAccommodations for Students with Disabilities\nEmerson is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through the provision of reasonable accommodations, so that each student may fully participate in the Emerson experience.
