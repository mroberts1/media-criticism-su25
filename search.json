    "text": "W2: Simulation & Pastiche: Postmodernism\n\n\n\nAmalia Ulman; Instagram Alastair Sooke, “Is This The First Instagram Masterpiece?” (The Telegraph, 18 January 2016) “Amalia Ulman: Meme Come True” (Dazed) Emilie Friedlander, “Social Anxiety: Why Amalia Ulman’s Fake ‘Middlebrow’ Instagram Is No Different From Yours,” (Fader, 7 November 2014)\nTo watch:\nEl Planeta (Amalia Ulman, 2020) Inventing Anna, episode 6 (Netflix, 2022)\nClaudio Bravo, Madonna (1979)\nYou’ve heard of postmodernism, of course—who hasn’t? As arguably the most influential cultural movement of the past half century, it’s almost inescapable today, ubiquitous across the spectrum of the arts, from Warhol to Jeff Koons, Twin Peaks to Stranger Things, Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction to Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs—okay that’s enough, I could go on for the entire lecture…\nBut what exactly is postmodernism? When did it start? And has it ended yet? In keeping with my approach in the course thus far, rather than plunging into dense theoretical texts, we will explore postmodernist aesthetics through some representative examples—in this case the works of the U.S. artist Cindy Sherman and the more recent Argentinian artist Amalia Ulman.\nSince there simply isn’t sufficient space here to explore all of the many facets of postmodernism, some basic distinctions and pointers will have to suffice. For a deeper dive, your starting point should probably be Fredric Jameson’s influential essay, “Postmodernism or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism”, followed by his book; or the French social theorist Jean Baudrillard’s classic book Simulacra and Simulations. But you don’t have to start with either of these texts. The first book I read on postmodernism was actually about architecture, Charles Jenks’s book The Language of Postmodernist Architecture, which has some illuminating discussion of the differences between modernist and postmodernist architecture.\nAn initial distinction is useful between postmodernism, which refers to an aesthetic movement extending across the spectrum of the arts, and postmodernity, a broader term that refers to a general condition (the reference points here being Jean-François Lyotard’s influential book The Postmodern Condition and David Harvey’s The Condition of Postmodernity) of society that has come to characterize the experience of global societies in the second half of the twentieth century and the first part of the twenty-first. I’m not going to get into the nature of postmodernity here, but suffice to say that postmodernism in the arts can be thought of as the artistic and cultural counterpart of the conditon of postmodernity itself.\nWhat follows can be considered a kind of “Postmodernism 101” that assumes that you know very little about postmodernism at the outset, and suggests some lines of inquiry to follow if you’re interested in exploring it in more depth.\nSo what do the diverse group of artists mentioned so far—Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, David Lynch, Quentin Tarantino, Jeff Koons, Wes Anderson, Amalia Ulman, and many more—have in common, aesthetically speaking?\nWhile people who have tried to define postmodernism agree that it can mean many different things, most would agree that one of its defining characteristics is pastiche, or what Fredric Jameson called “blank parody”. Pastiche here refers to the mimicry of particular historical styles, irrespective of the artistic field in question—painting, architecture, cinema, television, music, comics, and so on.\nConsider, for example, the image at the top of this page, Madonna by the Chilean artist Claudio Bravo. At first glance, you might easily mistake it for a Renaissance painting, in terms of its apparently religious subject matter, the vaguely biblical background that recalls religious illustrated books, and the symmetrical composition. The figure on the left pierced with arrows, for example, recalls the Christian martyr St. Sebastian, the subject of numerous Renaissance paintings. It might come as a surprise, then, to learn that the painting is a contemporary one (1979). The image first came to my attention in the early 1990s when it was used on the cover of an album by the Ensemble Alcatraz, Visions and Miracles (1988), a vocal group specializing in medieval and early modern music based in the San Franciso Bay area. The label website describes the album thus:\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula in the 13th century was home to a great exchange of cultures. One result: the cantiga, a combination of old and new musics from Christian, Muslim, and Jewish sources that told stories of adventure, calamity, and redemption, here brought to life by the Ensemble Alcatraz.\n\nIn Claudio Bravo’s pastiche of Renaissance painting, and the Ensemble Alcatraz’s eclectic pastiches of 13th-century Iberian music, we are already deeply immersed in postmodernist aesthetics. One of the characteristics of postmodernist painting is a return to figurative representation, in reaction against the abstraction that was one of the hallmarks of modernist painting, from the geometric minimalism of Mondrian to the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock.\nOne could spend a lot of time exploring postmodernist aesthetics simply within painting, from the 1960s “Pop Art” of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein to more recent examples. Both of these artists exemplify another key principle of postmodernist aesthetics: the embrace of popular media such as comics and the mass-cultural imagery of advertising, collapsing the modernist hierarchy between “high” (avant-garde) art and the “low” art (kitsch) of consumer mass culture.\nRather than painting, a particularly interesting starting point for exploring postmodernist aesthetics is photography. The 1970s saw the emergence of a number of female artists whose work engaged in different ways with photography as a means of elaborating a new, postmodernist aesthetics. They included Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, Sherrie Levine, or Sandy Skoglund (I leave you to Google any of these), but the two artists that I’m going to discuss today are of particular interest because of how their photographic work engages with the cinematic (Cindy Sherman) and social media (Amalia Ulman).\n\nCindy Sherman\nCindy Sherman is best known for her series of photographs (I think there are over 70 in all) dating from the late 1970s (1977-80) in which she elaborately stages stereotypical female roles that look uncannily like they are film stills from popular movies—the only difference being that the movies in question don’t exist. The main image for the course syllabus is a collage of some of the best-known of these photographs. Take a closer look at it, and click on the image to find out more about the series.\n\nSo what is “postmodernist” about this project? First, and related to the earlier discussion, because as the title of the series itself (Untitled Film Stills) makes clear, the photographs pastiche (that is, mimic or imitate) the visual style of the film still as a media format often seen in newspapers, magazines, and promotional matierals (such as film posters). In addition to the photographs’ formal mimicry of the film still, moreover, they also pastiche the visual style of popular films genres often problematized for their stereotypical portrayals of women, notably the well-known femme fatale stereotype of 1940s-1950s film noir. Some of Cindy Sherman’s photographs can be seen as pastiching the visual codes of film noir, most obviously in her decision to shoot on black-and-white film stock, reproducing the monochromatic look that is one of the most striking visual characteristics of film noir. It should be remembered that while the default film stock for photographers (especially photojournalists) well into the 1960s was black and white, even though shooting in color had been technically possible long before then, by the 1970s color had so become the norm that to choose to shoot in black and white already lent a retro that has become one of the hallmarks of postmodernist aesthetics. Sherman’s decision to shoot in black and white, then, is another (easily overlooked) element of their stylistic pastiche of the monochromatic aesthetic both of film noir and historical photography.\nWhat’s so fascinating about Sherman’s film stills, though, is that even though some of them can be seen as stylistic pastiches of film noir, in many other photographs it’s far less clear which cinematic genre is the object of pastiche. While there’s often a strong visual sense of déjà vu, evoking a popular film of the 1950s or 1960s, they key point is the indeterminacy of the reference—the fact that we can’t identify the photograph with any specific historical film or film genre.\nThis brings us to another defining concept of postmodernist aesthetics: simulation. The concept was elaborated in several classic essays in the 1970s by the French social theorist Jean Baudrillard, notably in his book (mentioned earler) Simulacra and Simulations (1979). For Baudrillard, the postmodern world is dominated by what he calls simulacra (sing. “simulacrum”), a new form of representation that essentially reverses the hierarchical relationship between the model and the copy. Historically, in the history of art, the model—in the form of the original work of art—has always preceded the copy: there is only one Mona Lisa, even though there are thousands of copies of Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting.. The age of what Baudrillard calls the simulacrum—the postmodernist age—is defined by the reversal of this hierarchy, by the ascendancy of copies without models (which is what Baudrillard means by simulacra). Whereas in the era of realism, what was still understood as the “real world” preceded representation of it (regardless of the medium—literature, painting, photography, cinema, TV), by the 1970s, Baudrillard argued, the relationship between the real and representation had reversed, or perhaps more accurately the distinction between the two had collapsed: henceforth, claimed Baudrillard, “reality” had become effectively indistinguishable from mass-media representations of it, or what he and the Italian semiotic theorist Umberto Eco called hyperreality.This is why the Mona Lisa has what Walter Benjamins calls aura, its historical uniqueness in space and time\nWe don’t need to go any further at this point to understand how the photography of Cindy Sherman, as well as many other artists like her in the 1970s, could be seen as an artistic commentary on the hyperrealist world that Baudrillard was describing. Sherman’s Film Stills photographs are also copies without models in the sense that what semiotic theorists would call their referent—the original film from which they are sourced—does not exist. They are what Baudrillard might call cinematic simulacra.\nOver the past few decades, Cindy Sherman has become increasingly revered as one of the most influential figures in the emergence of postmodernist aesthetics since the 1970s. Her photographic critique of stereotypical representations of women in popular cinema was part of the larger current of feminist critiques of patriarchal representation, from Laura Mulvey’s influential critique of the male gaze in her mid-1970s essay to Chantal Akerman’s groundbreaking film Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975). Sherman has continued her exploration of female representation right up to the present, and even has an Instagram account. An episode of the recent Netflix series Inventing Anna includes an episode in which characters discuss her work at a gallery retrospective, and includes a brief cameo by Sherman herself, wearing the same head-scarfed outfit that she wears in one of her original Film Stills photographs, essentially re-enacting her own earlier roleplay in the photograph. (Could it be any more postmodernist?!?). The inclusion of Sherman in the show could scarcely be more appropriate, given that its subject is Anna Sorokin, who conned luxury hotels and her wealthy New York socialite friends by masquerading as a German heiress called Anna Delvey–another stunningly postmodernist example of “representation” usurping the place of reality.\n\n\nAmalia Ulman\nCindy Sherman’s Instagram account (in fact, she has several) provides a link between her 1970s performance-art photography exploring female identity and the work of the social media artist Amalia Ulman, which can arguably be seen as continuing Sherman’s project in the twenty-first century domain of social media. If you read any of the articles about Ulman’s work linked to as this week’s reading assignments, you should by now have a good idea of how she fits into the larger framework of postmodernism that I have been sketching out in the preceding discussion. As with Sherman’s Film Stills, and as with a number of similar postmodernist feminist artists (the French artist Sophie Calle is another example), in her fake Instagram account Ulman fabricated a stereotypical female persona as an art project, exposing through the sexist comments of her male admirers the continuing pressure on young women to conform to the visual pleasure of the male gaze almost half a century since Laura Mulvey’s critique, and in spite of “postfeminist” celebrations of the power of female sexuality Ulman’s work can in fact be seen as developing such as critique through masquerade, photography, and social media platforms in a manner that continues the artistic critiques of so many other postmodernist feminist artists since the 1970s.\nJust as Cindy Sherman’s Film Stills project explored stereotypical representations of women in cinema, Amalia Ulman has recently gone a step further by directing her first feature film, El Planeta, that continues her exploration of representations of female identity in the social media age more directly in cinematic form. The film’s opening sequence again sees Ulman role-playing, this time posing as a call girl negotiating sexual and financial arrangements with a future client in what subsequently proves to be (like her Instagram persona) a pure fabrication that ruthlessly exposes the objectification of women in patriarchal society. The masquerades continue after this initial one, from her later (apparent) impersonation of an international designer to her later romantic roleplay in her date with the Asian guy that she meets in the gift shop. Both she herself and her mother (played, in fact, by Ulman’s own mother), it turns out, are engaged in role-playing a fantasy of a glamorious lifestyle that has no relation to their impoverished socio-economic reality—a masquerade that is ultimately exposed in the mother’s arrest for shoplifting with which the film ends.\nIt’s worth noting, finally, that as with Cindy Sherman’s film stills, Ulman’s 2022 film is also in black and white, stylistically pastiching not film noir in this case but the French New Wave films of Jean-Luc Godard, Agnès Varda, or François Truffaut, many of which also engage with the problematic position of women in the French society of their time. It’s interesting in this regard to think about the relationship between El Planeta and Varda’s film Cléo from 5 to 7, or Godard’s film with Anna Karina, Vivre Sa Vie which explores themes similar to those in Ulman’s film. I leave you to think about those connections, but suffice to say that Ulman’s black-and-white pastiche of a New Wave film also attests to the legacy of postmodernist aesthetics half a century after Cindy Sherman’s iconic film stills.",

Please email me with your meeting requests and available windows.\nZoom Office Hours: by appointment\nhttps://emerson.zoom.us/j/96415591363 (Passcode: 923351)\nCourse Description\nThis online, asynchronous course examines approaches to the analysis and criticism of contemporary media. You will learn how to become critical of the media messages you use and create, and how to think and write with agency.\nThere are two components of this course:\n\nA survey of such critical approaches/methods as semiotics, psychoanalysis, genre studies, feminist theories, cultural studies and postmodernism;\nThe application of these approaches to examining and critiquing various media forms and contents. We will spend a major part of this semester building up theoretical/methodological foundation while devoting the remaining to the critique and analysis of specific media texts and contexts.\n\nThrough extensive reading, writing, class discussion and screening, you will begin to develop the ability to analyze and critique popular media messages and images, as well as develop a critical worldview.\nStudent Learning Objectives\nBy the end of the course, students should be able to:\n\nIdentify a variety of critical and theoretical approaches to the media\nDevelop and refine critical reading strategies, both in terms of the media and writings about the media\nCultivate a suitable academic vocabulary and the ability to write, think and create from a critical perspective\nAppreciate an ethically-based and de-centered global perspective on media form and function, sensitive to the work of minority critics and theorists under-represented in the canons of media criticism\nApply theory to practice, and engage with contemporary media production and consumption as critically aware media artists\n\nRequired Texts\nMark Fisher, Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative? (Winchester, UK, and Washington, USA: Zero Books, 2009).\nAllissa V. Richardson, Bearing Witness While Black: African Americans, Smartphones, and the New Protest #Journalism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020).\nSupplementary readings, available on Canvas (see bibliography).\nCourse Structure and Requirements\nSchedule\nThe course begins on Wednesday 2 July and ends on Tuesday 19 August. Each week of the course accordingly begins on a Wednesday and ends on the following Tuesday.\nLectures, Discussion Forums, and Weekly Response Posts\nEach week, I will post a lecture, either in textual or video format, usually by Friday of the week in question.\nIn the lecture, I will assume that you have done the reading assignments for the week, so make sure to complete them before reading (or watching) the lecture.\nThe lecture will typically introduce some relevant examples relating to the readings that we can use as a starting point for the week’s discussion. However, you are also very welcome to suggest examples of your own that may come to mind after reading the course materials and the lecture.\nEach week, your initial Response post is due no later than the last day of the week in question (i.e. Tuesday in this case). You are then required to post at least 2 follow-up responses to any other group members’ posts (or my own) during the subsequent week. The Discussion cycle for each weekly topic therefore extends over two weeks:\n\nBy the end of the first week (Tuesday): initial response post\nBy the end of second week (the following Tuesday): min. 2 follow-ups to other people’s posts\n\nDon’t sweat too much about meeting exact requirements for post length and frequency! The purpose is for us to have a lively, productive discussion of each week’s readings so keep that as your main goal. Forums will also stay open beyond the biweekly cycle so you can catch up with posts later if you have time.\nAssigned Readings\nPlan on reading every assignment as listed on the course calendar. Since the reading will both inform and enhance material covered during class, please complete the reading assignments prior to watching the lecture videos.\nAttendance and Participation\nFull participation in class discussions and timely submission of all assignments constitutes evidence of class attendance. Students are expected to allocate sufficient time to complete all the requirements for each module: reading, viewing, responding to discussion questions, submitting replies to classmates, and completing other assignments on time. Failure to keep up with the pace of the course may result in lower grades or the failure of the class.\nDiscussion Forums and Weekly Response Posts\nEach week you are required to post a response of approximately 100-250 words to the course readings and/or the weekly lecture. The purpose of this assignment is for you to reflect on lectures, reading assignments or media clips and to pose questions. Along with your initial post, you are also required to respond to at least two (2) of your peers’ comments. Response posts are usually due by the end of the week in question: in this case, since the course began on a Wednesday, posts will be due by the Tuesday of the following week.\nIndividual Papers\nEach of you will write two analytical papers, which are due on June 9 and July 7 respectively. For the second paper assignment, you have the option to do a creative project (instead of a paper) using either BCS or Postmodernism concepts. Detailed instructions of the assignments are posted on Canvas. Feel free to consult with me if you have questions about an assignment or think you need extra help.\nResponse Papers\nYou will write two response papers responding to Gone Girl and Paris Is Burning in the contexts of the assigned readings. Each response paper is one single spaced page long (roughly 500-600 words). Your grade depends on how well you analyze and critique the film and how well you incorporate the readings into your critique/analysis.\nThe grading scale for papers is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nThis is excellent scholarly work that could be published in a student film or media studies journal. It displays good structure (i.e., a strong original thesis statement and a logical development of points to follow), content (sound analysis and good research when applicable), and presentational skills (i.e., excellence in verbal, logical, and grammatical expression, as well as care in mechanical details such as spelling, typing, bibliography and footnote preparation, etc.). It also follows style and formatting rules. (A=95).\n\n\nB\nThis is good scholarly work that could be published in a student journal with some adjustments. It has minor problems in a couple of the aforementioned areas. (B=85)\n\n\nC\nThis work exhibits problems in several of the aforementioned areas or a major problem in one. (C=75)\n\n\nD\nThis work exhibits little understanding of the subject matter or paper requirements. It fails to follow rudimentary formatting and displays sloppiness in spelling, grammar and sourcing. (D=65)\n\n\nF\nThis work exhibits no understanding of the subject matter or paper requirements. It fails to follow rudimentary formatting and displays sloppiness in spelling, grammar and sourcing. (F=55)\n\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nDo not plagiarize. Plagiarism is using someone else’s work without giving them fair credit. Plagiarism and cheating will result in an “F” for the assignment.\nDisability Statement\nAccommodations for Students with Disabilities\nEmerson is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through the provision of reasonable accommodations, so that each student may fully participate in the Emerson experience. Student Accessibility Services (SAS) staff will be working remotely for the fall of 2020. If you have a disability that may require accommodations, please contact them at SAS@emerson.edu or at (617)824-8592 to make an appointment with an SAS staff member.\nStudents are encouraged to contact SAS early in the semester. Please be aware that accommodations are not applied retroactively.\nPlagiarism Statement\nIt is the responsibility of all Emerson students to know and adhere to the College’s policy on plagiarism, which can be found at: http://www.emerson.edu/policy/plagiarism*.

    "text": "W2: Ideology and the Orwellian\n\n\n\nLouis Althusser, “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses”\nMark Fisher, Introduction to Capitalist Realism\nMark Fisher, excerpt from “Lecture 1: What Is Postcapitalism?”, in Postcapitalist Desire: The Final Lectures (2020)\nThe notion of ideology is one of the most complex—and perhaps for that reason one of the most widely misunderstood—theoretical concepts. The usual entry points, such as Terry Eagleton’s book Ideology, can quickly overwhelm the newcomer with distinctions and definitions; Eagleton alone comes up with six different definitions of ideology by the end of the book’s opening chapter. More accessible introductions such as the Slovenian theorist Slavoj Žižek’s in Sophie Fiennes’s documentary The Pervert’s Guide to Ideology (2012) are recommended, but can also be quite confusing.\n\n\nI recommend the opening sequence, in which Žižek uses the example of the 1980s film They Live as an introduction to thinking about ideology.\n\nThe standard introductory text on ideology is the French Marxist theorist Louis Althusser’s chapter which I’ve assigned. It’s also not an easy read (this is theory, after all), but the section at the end about the process of what Althusser calls interpellation (aka “hailing”) as one of the key operations of ideology is a bit easier to understand. It’s related to the notion of subjectivity and Althusser’s key idea that ideology continually addresses us, and constructs our identities, as subjects, in the political sense of the term “subject” (people who are the subjects of a monarch, etc.). In other words, ideology isn’t just a set of ideas and values that we take for granted as “normal” or “natural” (which is part of it), but more fundamentally, it shapes our very sense of who we are, our sense of our own identity and its relation to the wider world; our subjectivity, in other words. One of the ways it does this is by what Althusser calls “interpellating” us–calling out to and addressing us as particular kinds of subjects. For example, within the ideology of capitalism (only one kind, but the dominant one within which we are all immersed and that frames our sense of identity unless we are, say, anarchists or communists), the institution of advertising interpellates us as subjects: that is, it continually and directly addresses us, calling upon us to participate in capitalism as responsible citizen-consumers by consuming a multitude of commodities (including of course media commodities) and services that keep markets for these commodities and/or commodified services ticking over and growing. On a more general level, advertising is based on and reproduces the basic assumption that capitalist exchange is a “normal” and “natural” practice.\nIt isn’t just advertising that interpellates us in this way, of course. Governments and their related institutions continually interpellate us as national citizens, in the direct address to us of political leaders, government representatives, the police, or news anchors. It’s no coincidence that Althusser’s example of interpellation involves a policemen calling out to us “Hey you!”. In different ways, all of the messages politicians and government institutions address to us do the same thing—here in the UK, for example, one of the most irritating messages that interpellates us constantly on trains, the subway, or at airports is “If you see something, say something” and its related slogan, “See it, Say It, Sorted”. This addresses “us” collectively as responsible national citizens united in our opposition to and struggle against unspecified “terrorist” others seeking to attack our society. Ideological interpellation is at its height during wartime (especially for recruitment: “England needs you!”), and persists in commodified form in the merchandise of “Keep Calm and ”.\nIf our subjectivity roughly corresponds to the mode of address of interpellation, we are likely to receive these ideological messages without a second thought; it’s only if you have a different kind of identity or subjectivity that you notice, for example if you are watching French news (assuming that you can understand French) as a non-French person.\nIdeology and its practice of interpellation arent’ just limited to the political or economic (capitalism) domains though. If you are a woman, especially a feminist, living in a patriarchal society, for example, you will no doubt notice (and feel alienated by) its continual interpellation of male heterosexual subjects and ignoring of women (“Hi guys!”). If you identify as non-binary, you will be in constant struggle with the oppressive heteronormativity and binarism of the dominant culture. If you are a vegan, you will notice the dominant ideology of meat-eating and how it continually assumes that it is the norm to which vegetarianism or veganism is the exception (although this of course has changed significantly in recent decades). But to white cisgender meat-eating heterosexuals (!!!), everything they do is “normal” because their identity is framed by their ideology that they remain unaware of it until it is pointed out to them. As Žižek points out, this is an uncomfortable process, since ideology is what to “us” (i.e. the people within a particular ideology) feels normal and natural. Having your ideology challenged by someone, or leaving it, is a painful process that forces you to leave your ideological “comfort zone”.\nWhat is your position on hunting animals? Did you grow up in a family that has routinely hunted animals for generations? Try discussing that with an animal-rights activist. This is a conflict not just between two different ideologies—in this case, an “anthropocentric” ideology that considers animals as inferior and not entitled to the kind of rights that humans have, and a “non-anthropocentric” ideology that contests this—but between two fundamentally different forms of identity and subjectivity. As this example shows, ideology is inseparable from language, or more specifically what Michel Foucault calls discourse (which you can think of as ideological language), and arguments about ideology are often arguments about language: “anthropocentric”, for example, is a relatively recent term that originates in the discourse of animals rights, precisely as a critique of anthropocentric ideology. On the other side of the political spectrum, the term “woke” is a term used by dominant social groups to frame efforts to challlenge their dominant position in political hierarchies and their control over the forms of representation that circulate within it.\nCapitalist Realism\nMark Fisher’s concept of capitalist realism, outlined in the introduction to his 2009 book of the same name, marks an attempt to identify an ideology produced within and about capitalism itself since the collapse of Eastern European communist dictatorships at the end of the 1980s. While the concept of capitalism itself of course originates in the much older discourse of Marxism, it’s the notion of realism that is the ideological core of the concept. “Realism”, in this context, is the apparently ideology-free assumption that in declaring that the fall of Communism demonstrates that—for all its faults—there is simply no alternative to capitalism, no other political-economic-social way of life outside it, one is simply being realistic; as if this was simply the reasonable conclusion that any rational person would reach. In fact, it’s precisely where such “rational” or “objective” explanations are invoked that we are most likely to be in the domain of ideology, since to invoke “reason” or “objectivity” is itself a deeply ideological move. In this case, the objective of the ideology is to ensure the continuation of the existing (capitalist) status quo by pre-emtively closing off any possibility of imagining any other ways of living beyond it. To do so, it can be argued, is in itself an inherently ideological move (since ideology always wants to assume that it is the “right way”), but also a political move.\nThe short section from Mark Fisher’s lecture about what he calls “postcapitalist desire” (or the lack thereof…) I think provides a mini-case study in the operations of capitalist realism and how it operates in contemporary media culture and is reproduced by it. The 1984 superbowl commercial is widely regarded as a classic event in the history of advertising, but to my knowledge has not been subjected to the kind of ideological analysis that Fisher gets into in those few pages. Anyway, here are the two 1984 commercials that he references in the lecture. Take a look at them and then (re)read the except from the lecture.\n\n\nReturning to what I was saying earlier about advertising and ideology, we can see that both the Apple and the Levi’s commercials are interpellating “us” (we Americans in this case) as (consumer) subjects who they want to agree with the (capitalist-realist) worldview they present, in other words as people from the cool, colorful capitalist world rather than the bleak monochrome one of communist totalitarianism. Deep down, both commercials suggest, everybody wants Apple computers or Levis, even if totalitarian regimes deny them access to it. In fact, one can imagine a similar commercial being made today that frames North Koreans as “naturally” wanting to become part of consumerist South Korea.\nIn ideological terms, what’s interesting about the Apple commercial in particular is how advertising itself is invoking “ideology” as it is commonly framed by capitalist realism, as something that equates George Orwell’s classic dystopian novel 1984 with Eastern-European totalitarianism (declining but still very much alive when the commercial was made, of course). What’s interesting in this case, though, is how Apple is sort of mapping the political distinction between totalitarian conformity and revolutionary freedom onto its own relationship to its economic competitor, Microsoft: most explicitly in the resemblance between the bespectacled Great Leader on the screen and Bill Gates! So Apple is in a way co-opting the visual language of political revolution as a marketing strategy by positioning its competitor as a “boring”, autocratic regime being overthrown by a “revolutionary” insurgent (ie. Apple). This has become a common strategy in advertising and promotional culture, where “Revolution” is often coopted in branding and marketing (consider MTV’s 1980s slogan, “Revolution™”).\nMany similar examples could be found today. A particularly interesting example is the graphic artist Shepard Fairey’s iconic poster of Barack Obama that became ubiquitous in Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign:\n\nPrior to the Obama poster, Fairey was better known as the creator of the André the Giant “Obey” poster (see image above). The “Obey” poster can in fact be seen as an early example of advertising’s coopting (in ideological terms this is called “recuperation”) and commodification of the visual iconography of totalitarianism itself, along with its counterpart, revolution, in the endless variations on the iconography of the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-Tung or the Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara. Shepard Fairey has converted his propaganda-inspired images into a highly successful brand.\nOne can, of course, find innumerable examples of such “post-Communist” capitalist realism in everyday media culture. Even the dreary architectural realities of 1970s Communist architecture and everyday life have today been reified (turned into commodities) objects of nostalgia in []“post-Soviet” aesthetics](https://www.nssmag.com/en/fashion/24757/post-soviet-aesthetic).\nMeanwhile, streaming platforms such as Netflix are awash in hugely popular drama series that are allegedly also examples of what Fisher calls capitalist realism. Paradoxically, capitalist dystopias are among the most popular forms of commercial entertainment. A case in point is arguably the hugely-successful Korean series Squid Game, a show that while ostensibly a satirical critique of the social and economic injustices of capitalism (notably its system of debt), arguably serves to reinforce the ideological idea of the inescapability of capitalism itself: in the world of Squid Game as in so many other similarly “anti-capitalist” series and movies, there is simply No Alternative.",

From this point, even biological men can be framed as “female”. In her controversial WIRED article, feminist theorist and cosplayer Alex Quicho draws on both Tiqqun’s and Andrea Long Chu’s texts to elaborate the audacious and apparently counterintuitive claim that “Everyone is a Girl Online”. Chu’s project of disarticulating femininity both from anatomy and gender seems vindicated in the ubiquitous social media trend of the babygirl, a biologically male but adorably tearful “sad girl” embodied by Kendall Roy from HBO’s series Succession or Pedro Pascal in… well, pretty much anything.\n\n\nAlex Quicho, “Everyone is a Girl Online” (WIRED, 11 September 2023)Emma Copley Eisenberg, “Notes on Frump: A Style for the Rest of Us” (heyalma, 10 August 2017)\nContrary to postfeminist enthusiasts of online girldom, we have Emma Copley Eisenberg’s critique of what she calls the Sexy Adult Woman [SAW] ideal through her defence of what she calls Frump, a modality of female identity deliberately oppositional to the patriarchal imperative of appealing to the cisgender male gaze.

    "text": "W1: Introduction: Sites of Struggle\n\n\n David Welch, “The Conquest of the Masses” (from The Third Reich: Politics and Propaganda (1993))\nUmberto Eco, “Semiological Guerrilla Warfare” (from Travels in Hyperreality: Essays, trans. William Weaver (San Diego: Harcourt, Inc., 1983))\nWhere to begin?\nOn the most fundamental level, the field of media today can be described as a site of struggle—or more accurately, as a multiplicity of sites of struggle: struggles over the representation and interpretation of real-world events; struggles over identity and whose voices are heard (and whose not); struggles over the political use of media, whether as a tool of corporate or state control, or resistance to it; struggles over ownership and property rights; struggles over media ethics; struggles over creativity and aesthetics; struggles over the environmental impact of media and communication technologies, and many more.\nPerhaps most importantly, though, today’s digital, networked media technologies and social media platforms are sites of struggle over meaning: over the often multiple, often contradictory meanings of media texts, practices, or rituals. The task of media criticism arguably begins with the question of meaning: what certain forms of cultural or media expression mean to different publics and audiences, and how meaning itself is not inherent or self-evident, but socially constructed by the often contradictory interpretations of different communities.\nWithin this larger, continually evolving field of meaning-making, media criticsm involves the analysis and decoding of media texts within specific interpretative frameworks, some of which we will be exploring in this course. They are drawn from a multiplicity of fields of knowledge in the humanities and social sciences, including linguistics (semiotics), literary theory (narrative), political economy (Marxism), psychoanalysis, social theory, feminism, ethnography, and cultural studies.\nThe fact that the interpretations of the same media texts are frequently contradictory doesn’t mean that they are equivalent in value in a relativistic way. On the contrary, many of the historical and still ongoing struggles over media meangings are struggles over power—over whose media practice, whose interpretation, is the dominant or valid one. It is often the practices and intrepretations of the most dominant groups within a society, or between societies, that are held to be the most valid ones. But resistant intrepretations and practices are always present, even when repressed, and may challenge or destabilize those of dominant socio-political groups.\nA Contemporary Example: Ghiblification\nIf all this sounds very abstract, it is useful to begin with a concrete example that exemplifies many of the preceding points. The example that I propose we consider this week is a very recent media practice that first emerged last spring (2025) and quickly became a site of struggle in all of the ways described above. It relates to generative AI—already in itself a huge site of struggle over the past few years—and specifically the upgrade to OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool last spring that introduced a new affordance that quickly became nothing less than a global media phenomenon: the ability to convert any photograph into the distinctive visual style of the globally popular Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli, using only a simple textual request (e.g. “Convert this into a still from a Studio Ghibli movie”). As with all of meme culture, many of the hundreds (probably thousands) of images generated quickly spread across social media platforms.\nI expect that all of you may have come across the phenomenon at the time, since it was so ubiquitous, but you may have been less aware of its scale and the controversies sparked by many of the practices that emerged from it. In case you missed it, though, and to get a sense of the scale of the phenomenon, take a look at this slideshow that I put together at the time.\nAmong the wildfire of controversies generated by the AI-Ghibli phenomenon, perhaps the most unexpected–often shocking–was its use use in political and indeed geopolitical contexts. To the outcry of many, even the White House appropriated the trend as part of its clampdown on immigration by posting a Ghiblified image on its official Instagram feed. But this was not an isolated event: take a look at this Twitter thread about the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\nAs you can see from the initial posts on the thread, it appears that the posting of Ghiblified photographs relating to the Gaza conflict was initiated by the Israeli Defence Force, but if you continue scrolling you will see that the practice was also used by pro-Palestinian or anti-Zionist sources. Just scrolling through this feed alone, I think you can see what I meant earlier by describing media as a site of struggle.\nWhile this may seem like a particularly complex example, I would argue that it’s actually quite typical of the complexities of contemporary media culture and the challenges it poses to the analysis of that culture. Within meme culture alone, one need only consider the strange afterlife of the Pepe The Frog meme, which was the subject of the documentary Feels Good Man (dir. Arthur Jones, 2020). If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend that you watch it, as it’s extremely relevant to our course!\nAs a cultural and political practice, media criticism sets out to make sense of all of this. How does it do this? What kinds of frameworks would enable us to understand examples such as the AI-Ghibli phenomenon or the alt-right’s political appropriation of the Pepe The Frog meme in the lead-up to the 2016 US election? Who would have thought that the charming visual style of Studio Ghibli’s much-loved films, many directed by the self-professed pacifist Hayao Miyazaki, would be appropriated as what appears to be a contemporary form of propaganda? Why would the White House, the IDF, or other political actors appropriate that style? What are they trying to communicate by doing so? I leave you to consider such questions, and am curious to hear what you think.\nIf you were wondering, then, why I assigned you to read one of the early chapters from David Welch’s study of propaganda in the Third Reich, or Umberto Eco’s chapter on what he calls “semiological guerrilla warfare”, then by now you may have a better understanding why. Even though Eco’s concept dates from the early 1980s, the AI-Ghibli images amply demonstrate that the age of social media, still several decades away at the time, is today very much a field of semiological guerrilla warfare—not just a war in the human sense but also a war of signs: the signs in question being the existing global cultural mythology of Studio Ghibli itself, which is appropriated in different contexts and for different political purposes as a kind of second-order ideological language. This appropriation of an existing corpus of signs within (global) culture is one of the fundamental practices of what the French literary theorist Roland Barthes called “Mythologies” in his 1957 book of the same name: the process by which ideology presents itself as “normal” or “natural” rather than historical and dependent on highly unequal political, economic, and social dynamics.\nA wider question raised by the examples I’ve been discussing are about the nature of propaganda itself. What exactly is “propaganda”? David Welch’s book on the Third Reich offers some useful starting points for reflecting on this subject, and its relevance to contemporary geopolitical contexts. If you’re interested in exploring this subject further, you’ll certainly need to watch Leni Riefenstahl’s film Triumph of the Will (1935), regarded as the class text of the Nazi propaganda machine. It still makes for chilling viewing today.",
